        "# Project 1: Social Sentiment Analysis for Stock Prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "# Introduction & Project Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "## Purpose\n",
        "The primary objective of this project is show how sentiment from social media (e.g., Reddit) and news articles can correlate with financial data (e.g., stock prices). This could help identify whether shifts in sentiment (positive/negative) have a measurable impact on stock price movements, which is crucial for traders, investors, or analysts who seek to incorporate alternative data sources into their decision-making processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important Note:** This project is aimed at exploring potential correlations between stock price movements and market sentiment.  It does not seek to establish causation or build a predictive model. The analysis will focus on identifying any statistical relationships between these variables, rather than determining if one directly causes the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Skills Showcased\n",
        "This project showcases my skills in data aggregation, cleaning, transformation, and merging datasets from different sources, as well as my proficiency in Python, SQL; and ability to work with PowerBI.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Selection of Pharma & Defence Stocks\n",
        "Pharmaceutical and defense sectors were selected due to their sensitivity to public perception and regulatory changes, making them ideal candidates for sentiment-based analysis. These sectors frequently experience significant/volatile price movements influenced by news coverage and social discussions, providing strong datasets for predictive analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Sources Selection\n",
        "\n",
        "### Reddit\n",
        "Reddit was chosen due to its popularity, extensive discussion threads, and niche-focused subreddits that specifically cover financial news, investment strategies, and sector-specific discussions (e.g., pharma and defense stocks).\n",
        "\n",
        "### NEWSAPI\n",
        "NEWSAPI provides access to diverse, credible, and timely news sources globally. It allows for comprehensive collection of articles relevant to the target companies, enhancing the quality and depth of the sentiment analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Twitter (Dropped)\n",
        "Originally, Twitter (X) was intended to be a primary data source. However, due to recent API limitations (restrictive access, high costs, and limitations on the volume of data retrieval), Twitter was dropped to ensure the feasibility, and sustainability of the project.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Notebook Objectives\n",
        "This notebook documents the step-by-step processes implemented during each project phase. Each phase is explained through relevant outcomes.\n",
