First few questions from the press in Geneva are about the math in the agreement. Does this mean 30% US tariffs on all Chinese goods?

The answer is, kind of. Greer says that the agreement announced today refers to the reciprocal tariffs imposed on April 2 and the Chinese retaliation.

Tariffs on China are now 30%...The 20% US tariffs imposed earlier this year on China goods in relation to fentanyl are still in place, he said. The rate also does not include any sector-specific tariffs imposed globally. So some Chinese goods would still face a higher levy.

Yes, if the China tarrifst stayed on for anything above 60% it probably would have swiftly led to an economic collapse that everyone would have felt, but now we still have baseline 10% tarrifs on everyone thats seems like its not going anywhere,, 25% on steel and aluminum, and 25% on car and car parts. Not to mwntion the canadian and mexican tarrifs, yhough il be honest, I don't know what falls under the exemption. These are real, these will affect the economy, these will cost jobs and business, and these will make everyone pay more for everyday lives.

stocks,"People need to start taking Trump literally - When he says buy, you should buy","I'm not in the US but I've been following Trump closely for the last few months. One thing that's becoming increasingly clear is that he's actually relatively predictable, because if he says he will do something he will generally do it. Take 'Liberation Day' as an example. He signalled that tariffs were going to be very high for days and weeks before the event. To me, it was quite obvious that the market was going to tank, and low and behold, it did.

Then, after Trump and his cronies made off with millions in shorts (speculation), he says ""NOW IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY"". As it turned out, it was in fact, a great time to buy, because mere hours later, he came out with the market pumping news that he was suspending all tariffs (except the global 10% one), for 90 days.

Then, on Friday, before this big China meeting in Switzerland, he does the exact same thing. ""THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY"", preceded by the news that tariffs were dropped to 30% (i.e. what they were before April). Markets have already pumped 3% this morning.

I've been saying for a while that people need to take him literally, and he's proved the theory right again. Obviously, it's worth cautioning that this is a madman that we're dealing with and anything is possible, but it seems it's worth taking his words at face value for those willing to take on a bit of risk.",873,428,2025-05-12 10:53:07

The Trump administration is negotiating a deal to send hundreds of thousands of U.S.-designed AI chips to G42, an Emirati firm previously scrutinized for its ties to China, highlighting a shift in U.S. tech policy ahead of Trump's visit to the Persian Gulf. This has created internal tensions between business leaders eager to finalize the deal and national security officials concerned about potential misuse of the technology, especially given G42's partnerships with companies like OpenAI and its connections to Chinese firms. The administration's approach contrasts with the Biden administration's rejection of similar sales due to fears of empowering autocratic governments with close ties to China, and it is also expected to announce a deal with Saudi Arabia for access to AI chips from companies like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.",99,22,2025-05-12 21:24:47

>The technology giant’s shares were up 7% in premarket trading, tracking gains in the wider market after Washington and Beijing agreed to temporarily slash the reciprocal tariffs on Monday. But Chinese imports will still be subject to a 30% levy in the U.S.

>Apple is among the most prominent firms caught in U.S.-China trade tensions, which intensified in recent months after a series of tariffs initiated by President Donald Trump.

>The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the WSJ report, which cited people familiar with the matter.

>Raising prices could help Apple cushion higher costs stemming from the tariffs that have hampered global supply chains and forced the company to shift more production to India.

>Apple said earlier this month that tariffs were expected to add about $900 million in costs during the April-June quarter and that it would source a majority of the iPhones sold in the U.S. in the period from India.

>Analysts have for months speculated about a price increase from Apple, but warned that such a move could cost it market share, especially as rivals such as Samsung try to attract consumers with AI features that Apple has been slow to roll out.

So I then I got way more diligent about what I purchased,  and during this big dip I never sold and bought the dip as much as I could afford.

https://english.news.cn/20250512/dd1006fc3d2d4b6890e9b52d9253cf48/c.html


Both China and the United States have said that they've made progress at trade talks between the two countries in Switzerland.

The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as ""productive and constructive,"" while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng said the talks were ""in-depth"" and ""candid"".

The pair were engaged in secretive closed-door discussions all weekend, in the first meeting since US President Donald Trump levied steep tariffs against China in January.

The talks were the first face-to-face meetings between the two countries since President Trump imposed a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, with Beijing responding with a 125% levy some US goods.

The huge tariffs caused turmoil in the financial markets and sparked fears of a global recession.

Full details from the talks will be jointly released on Monday.

Following the conclusion of the two-day talks in Geneva, US trade representative ambassador Jamieson Greer said ""the deal we struck with our Chinese partners"" would help reduce the US's $1.2tn (£901bn) trade deficit.

Mr Bessent said the US and China have made ""substantial progress"" on de-escalating the trade war, while Vice Premier He said the talks were ""of great significance to the two countries but also have an important impact on the stability and development of the global economy"".

He told reporters in Geneva that the meetings had been substantive, Reuters reported.

Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, inspector general of the World Trade Organization, called the talks ""a significant step forward.""

""I urge both nations to build on this momentum by continuing to develop practical solutions that mitigate tensions, restore predictability, and strengthen confidence in the multilateral trading system,"" she said in a statement.

On Saturday, following the first day of talks Trump praised the ""total reset"" on the relationship between the two countries.

In a social media post, the US president described the talks as being ""very good"" and said change had been ""negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner"".

""We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!"" Trump added.

An escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing has seen the US president hit Chinese imports to the US with tariffs of 145%. China retaliated with levies of 125% on some US goods.

On Friday, before the talks began, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Washington would not lower tariffs unilaterally, and China would need to make its own concessions.

Both sides issued various other warnings ahead of the meeting, with Beijing saying the US must ease tariffs while Bessent stressed that the focus was on ""de-escalation"" and this was not a ""big trade deal"".

Chinese state media reported that Beijing had decided to engage with the US after fully considering global expectations, the country's interests and appeals from American businesses.",662,268,2025-05-12 03:04:48
stocks,Megacap tech adds more than $800 billion in market cap after U.S.-China tariff pause,"Members of the so-called Magnificent 7 group added an aggregate $837.5 billion in market value on Monday after the U.S. and China agreed to pause most tariffs on each other’s goods.

It marked the largest collective move for the group since April 9.

Technology stocks — such as semiconductor firms and smartphone makers — have been hit hard as trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies threatened to disrupt supply chains and hurt some of the biggest U.S. businesses.

But investors breathed a sigh of relief after talks between the U.S. and China over the weekend yielded a temporary pause in “reciprocal” tariffs.

In the U.S., Nvidia, which still faces a number of restrictions on the chips it is allowed to ship to China, was around 5% higher on Monday, while AMD was also up about 5%. Broadcom rose around 6% higher, while Qualcomm added about 5%.

Other companies in the semiconductor supply chain also jumped. Marvell, which last week postponed a previously scheduled investor day due to macroeconomic uncertainty, surged 8%.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its U.S.-listed shares jump around 6%. TSMC’s Taiwan-listed stock closed before the tariff announcement.

In Europe, ASML, a supplier of critical machinery required to manufacture the most advanced chips, rallied 6%. Infineon was also sharply higher.

Semiconductors and some electronics received an exemption from President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs last month, but the U.S. signaled the reprieve was temporary and that these products could still be in line for special duties.

Investors have been concerned about the impact on major tech stocks, especially those with exposure to China such as Apple and Amazon, whose shares have been under pressure this year.

Apple, which still makes 90% of its iPhones in China, said during its earnings report this month that it expects tariffs will add $900 million to its costs for the current quarter. Apple shares rose about 6%.

Amazon jumped 8% on Monday. Many sellers on Amazon rely on Chinese products.

U.S.-listed Chinese tech stocks also surged. Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com were higher, alongside internet firm Baidu.

“With US/China clearly on an accelerated path for a broader deal we believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table in 2025 as investors will likely focus on the next steps in these trade discussions which will happen over the coming months,” Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said in a note on Monday.

“This morning is a huge win for the bulls and a best case scenario post this weekend in our view.”

First, I want to thank our Swiss host. The Swiss government has been very kind in providing us this wonderful venue, and I think that led to a great deal of productivity we’ve seen. We will be giving details tomorrow, but I can tell you that the talks were productive. We had the vice premier, two vice ministers, who were integrally involved, Ambassador Jamieson, and myself.

U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer:“This was, as the Secretary pointed out, a very constructive two days. It’s important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought. That being said, there was a lot of groundwork that went into these two days. Just remember why we’re here in the first place — the United States has a massive $1.2 trillion trade deficit, so the President declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs, and we’re confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to work toward resolving that national emergency.”",1022,632,2025-05-11 18:36:40

“Tariffs open the doors to crony capitalism. The government starts to pick winners and losers,” Citadel founder Ken Griffin told POLITICO at the Beverly Hilton during the Milken Institute’s Global Conference. “I thought that would play out over the course of years. It’s terrifying to watch this play out over the course of weeks.”

stocks,Unexplored $GOOG Bull Case: Hedge against a post AGI world,"There are a lot of bull theses on Google discussed on this sub.  However, none of them touches on the biggest reason to buy $GOOG. 

A post-AGI world is envisioned below:

“machines possessing human-level intelligence and can perform any intellectual task a human can. This could lead to significant societal shifts, including widespread automation of jobs, potentially altering employment structures and requiring new economic models like Universal Basic Income (UBI)”

Moving further in time, we may even reach ASI and that’s when Singularity is conjectured to occur. But our focus should be on a post AGI world which we are actually currently heading towards.

A post AGI world is very likely to see lost of existing jobs to AI. The counter to this is UBI. However, there is no guarantee UBI will ever occur. This is why investing in $GOOG is highly beneficial to hedge against this possible scenario.

In a post AGI world, there may be many players who are able to provide AGI services. One of the most, if not the most, formidable existing players to gain a significant share of AGI is $GOOG. 

There could potentially be trillions of dollars worth of wages replaced by AGI. On top of that, AGI will likely be used to create even more goods and services than before AGI. Meaning, this could easily become a multi trillion dollar industry. 

Now, if we lose our jobs, and there is no sufficient UBI to raise our living standards, we can at least benefit from a significant increase in our $GOOG investment. 

That means it is a good idea to buy $GOOG even if you believe that Google Search will not be redesigned and gets decimated. View that as a hedge against a post AGI world that many are fearing would happen. A type of insurance. 

$GOOG is definitely one of the best players to invest in for such a scenario. There are just no other public listed companies that can actually go toe to toe against ChatGPT, even the other Mag 7 behemoths. And there are no other companies who has the full stack of technologies required to run a state of the art AI. 

$GOOG’s value is not just as a good business to own, but also as an insurance against a post AGI world. ",24,35,2025-05-12 12:34:22

stocks,7 years Investing,"Just wanna share my experience since I started investing.

The start 2018:

\- I had a collegue from work who introduced me to investing. He was really helpful explaining stuff, and that really gave me the confidence I needed, to start the journey and understand what I was doing.   
Think that is prob the most important thing I got from all of this. Someone who can introduce you to this world.

\- At first I only played around 2k€. And picked the most obvious stocks I remembered back then, It was Intel.  I remember seeing Tesla at 50$ (pre 2020 so 12$ after stock split). Made my first mistake, my collegue advised me to take care because the company value was not correct and their profits did not justify their valuations, even tho my gut told me it was a good investment (in my country I was starting to see a lot of tesla) and I noticed it was becoming popular around the world. I sold tesla.

This was part of an investment strategy based on a pattern I was seeing, which was most stocks rose to earnings reports and then it was a 50/50 chance to dump or pump. And my strategy was to leave before earnings. Let me tell you that this prob works well with big well known companies but not so much with others. But I was getting out of control and wanted more and more thus including random companies like lemonade, nio, block etc...  You can also see that I joined the GME blackberry NOK stupidity

From 2021 to 2022 I was just trying to get early on emerging markets, Like cannabis, vegetable Meat, non-hormonal pill etc Random shit to be honest, and I'm glad I'm done with that. Let me tell you it's like trying to fish on a lake full of shit, 99.99% you'll get shit.

  
2023 The real gains started, I'm more seasoned and opportutinies came that honestly I'm proud I kept my head cool. 

Amazon at 100$, META at 175$ and at 112$. Even tho on my first buy 175$ I was down -40% I kept again my head cool and decided to buy again more. 

I remember seeing a lot of redditors claiming meta was going to fail that nobody was using facebook anymore and that metahorizon was going to bust the company yada yada. I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...

 I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.

Then it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, ""don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware"" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.

My final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.

Patience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.

stocks,"OpenAI negotiates with Microsoft for new funding and future IPO, FT reports","May 11 (Reuters) - OpenAI and Microsoft are rewriting terms of their multibillion-dollar partnership in a negotiation designed to allow the ChatGPT maker to launch a future IPO, while protecting the software giant's access to cutting-edge AI models, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.

A critical issue is how much equity in OpenAI’s new for-profit business Microsoft will receive in exchange for the more than $13 billion it has invested in the company to date, the report said. It said Microsoft is offering to give up some of its equity stake in exchange for access to new technology developed beyond the 2030 cutoff.

They are also revising terms of a wider contract, first drafted when Microsoft initially invested $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019, the report said.

Microsoft declined to comment on the report. OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.OpenAI has told investors it will share a smaller fraction of revenue with its largest backer as it moves ahead with restructuring, The Information reported last week. In January, Microsoft changed some terms of a deal with OpenAI after entering a joint venture with Oracle and Japan's SoftBank Group to build up to $500 billion of new artificial intelligence data centers in the U.S.

stocks,"Trade war is about more than just trade, China’s official news agency argues","China's official state news agency argued that the ongoing trade war between the United States and China is about much more than tariffs.

""At its heart, this is not just a trade dispute - it is an encounter between two fundamentally different visions in this age of economic globalization: one rooted in openness, cooperation and shared growth; the other driven by confrontation, exclusion, and zero-sum mentality,"" Xinhua wrote in commentary published early Sunday.

Writing in support of globalism, Xinhua added:
""China will firmly reject any proposal that compromises core principles or undermines the broader cause of global equity.""

To settle this trade battle, the Chinese publication said the Trump administration must rethink how it views tariffs and trade.

“If Washington is truly committed to resolving trade frictions through dialogue, it must first confront the harm its tariff-driven policies have inflicted not only on the global trading system, but also on its own economy and citizens,” Xinhua said.

They're huge. World's largest gold miner. Mines all over the earth. But they also mine copper. They produced 300 million pounds of copper last year. They have a **30 billion pounds** copper reserve. 

So for you bears: as chaos roams the planet and people seek safety the price of gold goes up. As the anticipated weakening of the dollar kicks in the price of gold goes up. And who's got the gold? **NEM**

But for you bulls say the global economy does just fine. Industry churns along great. So it needs lots of copper for all it's electronics right? So who's got lots of copper? **NEM**

stocks,Impact of US policy on stocks,"I've identified 10 economic issues facing the United States that I would like to talk about. Each of these issues reduce economic growth. I would be curious to know what everyone thinks about these issues.

1. Tourism - Typically, the US generates ~2 trillion in revenue from tourism per year. Overall, tourism is down around 13% this year. However, tourism from some countries are seeing a sharper drop. For example, Canadian tourism to the US is down around 30%. So far, this is expected to shrink the US economy by ~$200 billion. Additionally, seven commercial airplanes have crashed since Trump took office. Domestic and international travel is down.

2. Boycotts - People from other countries are boycotting US products due to their discontentment with the US. This discontent seems to be due to two factors. First, the US is transitioning from a constitutional republic to a totalitarian oligarchy. This is unpopular domestically and abroad. Second, tariffs have impacted foreign economies. For example, German auto workers are being laid off because their cars aren't being sold in the US as much. Canada has seem rising unemployment partially due to the tariffs too. Other countries will be impacted too. Ultimately, I don't know how much boycotting by foreigners will impact the US economy, but it is happening.

3. Debt (government, consumer, student) - US treasuries are being sold by foreign countries. This means that the US government must provide a greater return for US treasuries to entice foreign investment. This will reduce government spending because the government will be forced to spend more to repay it's debt.

Consumer debt is extremely high too. Consumers owe ~$1.6 trillion on their cars, and ~1.2 trillion on their credit cards. When consumers repay this debt, they are not expanding the economy. Instead, it's just a drain on the economy.

The White House has indicated that ~5 million student loans barrowers will have their wages garnished to repay their student loan debt. The Internet told me the average monthly payment for a student loan is $536/month. I think that seems high. I only pay $192/month. Still, these are barrowers who are unable to repay their student loans. All of their money is going to necessities or servicing debt. Now, they'll have less money to expand the economy.

4. Economic uncertainty - US tariff policy has been changing on a daily basis. Investors favor economies that are stable politically and economically. It's impossible to make long-term plans when policy can change on a daily basis. It's no wonder that corporation have been expanding into foreign economies when it's impossible to make a long-term plan due to policy changes. I don't have any numbers on how this could impact the economy, but it should be a drag. US consumers have been more conservative with their spending too amid recession fears.

5. Immigration - There are 47.8 million immigrants in the US. That's around 1/7 of the population. ~11 million are undocumented immigrants. ~750 are forcibly removed per day. However, immigrants are voluntarily fleeing the US due to negative sentiment about immigrants and dangers posed by the administration. It's unclear how many are leaving, but there have been worker shortages in meat packing and agriculture which are largely run by undocumented immigrants. Undocumented immigrants payed almost $100 billion in federal taxes last year with around a 8% effective tax rate. That means that they expanded the economy by over a trillion dollars.

Documented immigrants produce more for the economy than undocumented immigrants. Being able to immigrate to another country implies that a person has enough money to do so or that they have a valuable skill. ICE has been removing documented immigrants from the country too. These are people that typically produce more for the economy than the average citizen. Removing members from this group or discouraging others from immigrating to the US is a massive drain on the economy.

6. Federal worker firings - Somewhere between 120,000 and 250,000 federal workers have been fired by DOGE. These workers are largely now entering the private sector.

7. Transportation sector firings - UPS has fired 20,000 truck drivers. Also, imports have dropped ~1/3. There are around 85,000 longshoremen in the US. They may need to fire 20,000-30,000 in the near future.

8. Social security - Social security benefits have not been cut, but it's become harder to receive benefits due to DOGE. Many offices have closed. Phone lines have been cut. And, the social security website has gone down several times. Many seniors and disabled people have been missing their checks and have had little recourse to receive their benefits again. Also, social security will not pay for missed months. If a check is missed for a month, then the individual just needs to try and figure out how to get their check next month. Social security pays ~67 million people each ~$2,000/month (depending on several factors). A missed payment means that a family may need to cut their spending which shrinks the economy.

9. Political instability - Everything I've already mentioned is in the realm of politics. The other items I've listed are political, but I imagine I'll get the most push back for this item. The US is undergoing a coup. The administration has disobeyed a SCOTUS order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcias. So far, the White House has refused this order. Constitutional amendments, the right to due process, and birthright citizenship have all entered the sphere of what is considered political. Under the constitution of the US, none of these items are in question. However, the administration is attacking these items and more.

Coups can be very bad for business. Protests have been enormous. There's talk of having a general strike. Politically motivated violence is increasing. This directs resources away from expanding the economy.

10. Tariffs - A lot can be said about the tariffs. I've mentioned them a few times already. Imports have dropped by around a third. This is likely to be an inflationary pressure on the economy. People may not be able to find the items they want. It's bad bad bad. Real bad. Bad bad.

To be fair, there are some impacts on the economy that increase the value of stocks. For example, de-dollarization means that US goods are cheaper abroad. The dollar has already lost ~15% of its value since the Trump administration. This encourages foreign investment because it's easier for foreigners to get dollars to buy US treasuries or stocks. I may be inclined to make another post about impacts that are expected to increase the value of stocks.

stocks,US and China hold 2nd day of tariff talks. No breakthroughs but Trump touts 'great progress',"U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on social media that “great progress” was being made and even suggested a “total reset” was a possibility as the sides took their seats for the second and final scheduled day of discussions in Geneva.

Beijing has yet to comment directly, but its official news agency took a tough approach, saying China will “firmly reject any proposal that compromises core principles or undermines the broader cause of global equity.”

In its editorial, Xinhua said, “Talks should never be a pretext for continued coercion or extortion, and China will firmly reject any proposal that compromises core principles or undermines the broader cause of global equity.” As with the day before, the delegations left the villa designated for talks after a couple of hours for a lunch break.

stocks,US inflation starting to stir as Trump tariffs hit,"From Bloomberg: US consumer prices probably picked up in April after the smallest advance in nine months, foreshadowing a broader acceleration as many companies seek to pass on higher tariffs.

A closely watched gauge of prices paid by Americans for goods and services, excluding volatile food and energy costs, is forecast to have risen 0.3%, based on a Bloomberg survey of economists. In March, the so-called core consumer price index inched up just 0.1%. 

While Tuesday’s report is likely to show limited pass-through so far of higher US duties on imported goods, many economists anticipate the impact becoming more pronounced over time.

That helps explains growing apprehension among consumers about inflation specifically and the economy and job market more broadly. Retail sales due Thursday are expected to show some of that anxiety; after a healthy 1.5% jump at the end of the first quarter, economists forecast little change in April sales as front-loaded demand for motor vehicles cooled.

For their part, companies are threading the needle between attempting to mitigate the costs of tariffs through price hikes, and trying to guard against a drop in sales as consumers recoil from sticker shock.

stocks,Does Market Sentiment always change this fast in the stock market? I find incredibly amazing how things swung in just one month.,"So I am not gonna lie, I start investing in January, and I got bodied by liberation day and I panic sold because I was not able to witness and stomach such tremendous losses because I targeted individual stocks and I lost a lot, and I mean a lot, of money.

That's another story though, and I accepted that and need to grow obviously. I wish I didn't start investing at 27 though, but you live and you learn.

But the thing that shocks me, with my small amount of experience in the market, is how quickly the sentiment changes from April to now. We went from liberation day crashes and basically everyone fearing the world ending, to now, on this day, a deal with China coming in and every day the stock market pumped with a new headline.

I don't have much experience, but in previous large drops in the market, is this always the case that recovery happens this quick and sentiment can change drastically in a month? Or is this a unique scenario of what's going on right now?

stocks,(05/12) Interesting Stocks Today - Major Reductions in Tariffs!,"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

I don't know how sustained today's move will be- we've made a massive move upwards, and even 30% tariffs will still reduce business with China by 70% in the medium term (\~6 to 9 month timeframe)

News: [Us And China Agree To Major Reductions In Tariffs For 90 Days](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-12/us-and-china-agree-to-major-reductions-in-tariffs-for-90-days)

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d) **/** [**AMZN (Amazon)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&p=d)\- Both stocks are up \~6% following announcement of a 90-day suspension of U.S.-China tariffs, reducing U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%. Watching $214/$215 in AAPL and seeing if we can make another move higher. Currently long. Obviously this is a 90-day suspension and not actually a guarantee that things will return back to normal. Everything in consumer disc is moving off this news. Risks I'm seeing from this are potential re-escalation of trade tensions and more supply chain disruptions, and I'm thinking of possibly flipping short if we make a massive move upwards.

[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) **/** [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d)\- Chinese tech stocks like BABA and JD are also major winners of tariffs, with both up roughly 6%, following the 90-day agreement. Watching $135 level (basically just seeing which Chinese stocks are close to breaking highs). Risks are the same as American stocks. Other notable stocks I like on this are BIDU/TCEHY (trades OTC)

[**PFE (Pfizer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PFE&p=d) **/** [**MRK (Merck)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRK&p=d) **/** [**JNJ (Johnson & Johnson)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JNJ&p=d)\- Trump announced plans to sign an executive order implementing a ""most-favored-nation"" policy to reduce U.S. prescription drug prices by up to 59%. This policy aims to ""align"" U.S. drug prices with the lower prices paid by other countries. Obviously pretty terrible news for anyone investing in pharmaceutical stocks because it affects major revenue sources for this company. The US has limited direct negotiating and mainly relies on private pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate prices in insurance plans currently, which results in sky-high insurance costs. I'm Interested in MRK, we're already broken lows (even during the tariffs) because MRK is highly dependent on Medicare reimbursement (MRK).

[**BP (BP)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BP&p=d)\- BP up on reports that several major oil companies, including Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil, are evaluating potential takeover bids. BP is considered undervalued, with a market cap of £57B against asset valuations of \~£120B. No levels I'm watching at this time.

wallstreetbets,China removes Boeing delivery ban,"China has removed a month-long ban on airlines taking delivery of Boeing Co. planes, according to people familiar with the matter, following a breakthrough in trade talks with the US that temporarily slashed tariffs on each side.

Officials in Beijing have started to tell domestic carriers and government agencies this week that deliveries of US-made aircraft can resume, the people said, asking not to identified because the information is confidential. Discretion has been given for airlines to organize delivery on their own timing and terms, one of the people added. 

The resumption of deliveries to China will be an immediate boost to the Boeing. 

The thawing comes as the world’s two biggest economies agreed to a tariff truce, with the US lowering its combined 145% levies on most Chinese imports to 30% for 90 days. China agreed to slash its 125% duties on US goods to 10%, and remove other countermeasures taken against the US since April 2. Still, the restoration of jet deliveries could be short-lived if the tariff war isn’t resolved during the three-month reprieve. 

Boeing had found itself caught in the middle of the trade spat after President Donald Trump’s unveiling of tariffs on most major trading partners was met with retaliatory duties from China. That priced Boeing jets out of the market for Chinese carriers, while Beijing ordered airlines to stop taking deliveries of the company’s aircraft. 

Signs of a potential detente emerged in late April, when China said it was willing to support normal cooperation with US companies. Beijing had offered to suspend higher duties on some US imports, including medical equipment, some industrial chemicals and plane leases.",132,29,2025-05-13 06:33:47

(Reuters) -Amazon has hired FedEx to handle some of its large package deliveries, the companies said on Monday, weeks after UPS said it was halting its less-profitable deliveries for the e-commerce retailer and cutting 20,000 jobs.

FedEx shares surged on Monday even more than rallying Wall Street benchmarks, finishing up 7%. The Memphis-based delivery company said the multi-year agreement covers residential delivery of select large packages for Amazon.

The deal with FedEx, signed in February, gives Amazon ""cost favorability"" compared with delivery rival UPS, Business Insider had reported, citing an internal document.

The agreement will not replace UPS, Amazon said as FedEx will join its third-party partners, including UPS and the USPS, and work alongside its own last-mile delivery network.

FedEx called it a ""mutually beneficial, multi-year agreement"" in a statement.

The deal may signal a thaw in relations between FedEx and Amazon. The companies cut residential delivery ties in 2019 as Amazon was building its now sprawling network of delivery services.

UPS said in January it plans to shrink shipment volumes for Amazon, its largest customer, by more than 50% by the second half of 2026 to focus on fewer, but more profitable deliveries.

Late last month, UPS said it would slash 20,000 jobs and shut 73 facilities as a part of its planned reduction in Amazon deliveries, as well as cost-cutting and efficiency projects under a major operational restructuring.

FedEx and UPS have been in a fierce battle for market share over the last five years, often poaching whole or partial customer accounts from the other.",148,36,2025-05-13 01:30:50

President Donald Trump announced Sunday that he plans to resurrect a controversial policy from his first term that aims to reduce drug costs by basing payments for certain medicines on their prices in other countries.

His prior rule, called “Most Favored Nation,” was finalized in late 2020 but blocked by federal courts and rescinded by then-President Joe Biden in 2021. It would have applied to Medicare payments for certain drugs administered in doctors’ offices. However, it is unclear what payments or drugs the new directive would apply to.

In a Truth Social post Sunday evening, Trump said he plans to sign an executive order Monday morning that he argues would drastically lower drug prices.

“I will be signing one of the most consequential Executive Orders in our Country’s history. Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%,” he wrote. “I will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION’S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World.”

The directive comes as the Trump administration is also looking to impose tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, which had been exempted from such levies enacted during the president’s first term. The tariffs could exacerbate shortages of certain drugs, particularly generic medicines, and eventually raise prices.

If the new executive order is comparable to the 2020 rule, both Medicare and its beneficiaries could see savings. But it could also limit patients’ access to medications, experts said. Much depends on how the policy is structured.

Although lowering drug prices was a major talking point of his first administration, Trump has not focused on the topic as much this term. And his campaign told Politico last year that he had moved away from the “Most Favored Nation” model, which many Republicans strongly oppose.

But the administration revived the idea recently as a potential way to meet deep spending cut targets for Medicaid in the House GOP’s sweeping tax and spending cuts package. However, it’s unclear whether the proposal will be included in the legislation, the details of which should be announced shortly, or whether it would be covered by the executive order.

The initiative will likely face stiff opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which successfully halted the first iteration.

The Trump administration introduced the idea of tying Medicare’s drug reimbursements to the prices in other countries in 2018 and finalized the rule just after the 2020 election. The seven-year model would have allowed the US to piggyback on discounts negotiated by other peer countries, which typically pay far less for medications in large part because their governments often determine the cost.

Under the 2020 initiative, Medicare would have paid the lowest price available among those peer countries for 50 Part B drugs that are administered in doctors’ offices. The administration estimated it would have saved about $86 billion.

At the time, Medicare was barred from negotiating drug prices, but that changed with the 2022 passage of the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act, which gave Medicare the historic power to bargain over prices for a small number of drugs annually.

A “Most Favored Nation” proposal could save beneficiaries’ money in their out-of-pocket costs and their premiums, which are both affected by the price of drugs, experts said.",9718,2321,2025-05-11 23:43:23

investing,Tech stocks just lit up after that 90 day tariff ceasefire,"So the U.S. and China just agreed to a 90 day timeout on their crazy tariff rates cutting U.S. levies on Chinese imports from 145% to 30% and China’s on U.S. goods down to 10%. As soon as the news hit, the Nasdaq spiked over 4%, pushing it back into bull-market territory up more than 20% from its early April lows. Amazon jumped about 7.4% on hopes that lower duties will trim import costs and keep ad revenues flowing. NVIDIA wasn’t far behind, rallying roughly 5% as traders bet cheaper supply chains will turbocharge AI chip output. Even Tesla popped 8%, since investors figured fewer tariff headaches means smoother exports and production. Analysts hailed this as a “best case scenario” for risk assets but warned it’s only a temporary pause. If talks collapse in August, costs could jump right back up and markets might get choppy again.  Keep an eye on NVIDIA’s Q1 report later this month and any hints about extending this truce.  Once the 90 days are up, things could swing sharply if Washington and Beijing can’t lock in a longer term deal.  So yeah, tech bulls are partying now, but buckle up for some volatility if the ceasefire doesn’t stick.

So I’m definitely going to add to my position. LOL",205,95,2025-05-12 19:50:54

investing,Looking for advice... United Health UNH,"**Hi everybody,**

I just started investing but made a bad play. I saw the Trump news about cutting pharma costs right when he posted it on Truth Social. I thought I was making a “big brain” move by buying health insurance stocks like UnitedHealth, thinking they’d go up since they’d be paying less for medications (that was my logic at the time).

But when Trump officially announced it, UnitedHealth actually dropped further into the $375 range (I bought at $384). After thinking it through a bit more, I realized pharma companies are probably already selling to insurance companies at low prices—likely around the range Trump is aiming for—and it’s the insurance companies that are doing the markup. So it’s pharma stocks that might be okay, and insurance companies that could take the hit.

**What’s the best practice among investors when this happens?**  
I’ve already set a sell order at $370 but I’m unsure if I should sell earlier or hold the stock.

*P.S. I’m okay with losing it all. I just want to know the best practice when someone makes a bad read.*

From now on, for backdoor Roth conversions, can I contribute the $7000 into this rollover IRA and convert it from there, or would it be better to open a traditional IRA and do it from there?

I don't mind opening a new account, but if the one I already have can get the job done I might as well just keep it simple and use that.

investing,"Reinvesting REIT Dividends in a Roth IRA = ""Infinite Money Glitch"" - What is the catch?","Hello All! As the title suggests, I have a question about dividend investing within a Roth IRA, specifically with companies with high dividend payouts. The example company I will use is $DX.

I was recently pitched this idea:

Couple of assumptions:  
$DX grows at 2% a year. Dividend grows at 1% per year.

Say you have $285,000 in a Roth IRA and you are near 60 years old. If you allocated all $285,000 of this into $DX at approximately $12.45/share you would own \~22,891 shares. At a current monthly dividend of $0.17, you would recieve a monthly check of \~$3,891. If you were to reinvest your entire monthly dividend check back into $DX and repeat this process for awhile, you would accumulate many shares and your monthly payment would greatly increase.

Now, you have reached your retirement at age 68.5 and you have decided to take $12,000 per month for living expenses. However, by repeating the process above, your monthly dividend payment is \~$18,500, so you still have \~$5,500 to reinvest into $DX and thus grow your portfolio further and only live off of a portion of just the dividend payouts.

This seems like an ""infinite money glitch"" in theory, but I am wondering what the catch is or why this is not used more often? As of now, the only thing I have been able to come up with is lack of diversification. ",0,44,2025-05-12 20:38:07

If that sounds familiar, it's because Theranos similarly aimed to revolutionize diagnostic testing. The Silicon Valley start-up captured the world's attention by claiming, falsely, to have developed a blood-testing device that could run a slew of complex lab tests from a mere finger prick.

investing,Non Residency based insurance platforms - UK resident moving abroad,"Hi All, 

I'm currently a UK resident, investing with Vanguard in an ISA.

I'm moving abroad next year, to a country in which I hold citizenship, and I know that even though I am a UK citizen, I will lose the right to invest in my ISA, so I need to start looking for alternatives. 

I was wondering if anyone knows of any investment platforms that are not residency-based into which I could transfer my ISA, keep it there when I move abroad, and continue to invest in different instruments, just to keep everything in one place. I am not looking for portfolio advice, just a specific platform (Vanguard, AJ Bell, trading212 type thing).

I have looked at platforms specific to the country I'm moving to, it is **not the US** and I'm familiar with the tax implications of investing/having a foreign income out there. the only issue is I am not fluent in the language, not enough to be comfortable investing at least, and while I could hire a financial advisor I prefer to have my own control over my investments, so would prefer something I can fully understand.

investing,Primary Home as an Investment,"Earl and Willa were a working-class couple who spent their entire lives in modest jobs—he was a trash collector, she a typist—and never once invested in the stock market. Instead, they built wealth through a single, often-overlooked asset: their home. In 1970, they bought their first house for $30,000, scraping together a $3,000 down payment after years of saving. Over the next 49 years, they sold and bought homes more than seven times, steadily building equity with each move. By 2022, without any traditional investments, they had amassed over $950,000 in home equity—completely tax-free. While some argue that a house shouldn't be viewed as an investment, their story challenges that notion, proving that, under the right conditions, homeownership can serve as a powerful and accessible path to long-term wealth, especially for those outside traditional financial systems.",0,10,2025-05-12 21:42:23

investing,"Mega-caps will dominate the market long term (destroy my argument with logic, please)","**Thesis:** The largest mega-cap stocks will consolidate market dominance in the coming decades due to their privileged access to transformative technologies, structural advantages, and capital. Accordingly, portfolios with a bias toward mega-caps will tend to outperform others in the medium-to-long term.

**Argument:**

1. **The Trend Has Already Started.** Over the past ~5 years, U.S. mega-cap stocks have dramatically outperformed the broader market. For instance, the Magnificent Seven have collectively driven the majority of gains in the U.S. equities market (MAGS returned ~103% over past 5 years while QQQ returned ~60% and SPY returned ~41%—and the returns of Nasdaq and S&P would be significantly lower if MAGS’s returns were excluded). *Naturally, past performance is not a meaningful indicator of future performance under normal circumstances.* But I argue we are *not* in normal circumstances, and this trend is not a short-term anomaly. Rather, reflects deeper structural forces that are to likely persist, and even intensify.

2. **Entrenched Scale Advantages in the AI Age.** AI rewards scale, and the advantage of mega-caps in this respect is becoming deeply entrenched. Microsoft, for instance, has invested tens of billions into OpenAI. Google, Meta, and Amazon are pouring many billions into their own models. These giants have their sights set on owning the entire AI infrastructure, platforms, and ecosystems over coming decades. What will stop them from doing so?

3. **Data/Distribution Moats Will Be Unbridgeable.** The largest mega-caps today are comparable to old giants like Standard Oil. Standard Oil’s unparalleled control of oil enabled it to dominate the energy market in the late 1800s–early 1900s, gaining a near-monopoly and quickly becoming the largest corporation in the U.S. (Standard was dissolved by order of SCOTUS in 1911, but such an ending for the giants of today seems unlikely; we’ve grown tolerant of monopolies.) *Data is the new oil, and the largest mega-caps own the wells.* These companies control consumer platforms and cloud services that generate massive data: e.g. Google Search, YouTube, Amazon e-commerce, Facebook, Instagram, etc. Further, they control distribution channels — operating systems, browsers, cloud platforms. The long term value of these advantages is hard to overstate.

4. **Index Weighting and Capital Flows Feedback Loop.** Passive investing and index weighting dynamics favor the largest companies. As more capital flows into index funds and ETFs, those companies’ prices rise, and their index weight increases, leading to more inflows, which further inflates prices (“passive momentum” feedback loop). *This self-reinforcing cycle will contribute to the growing concentration of wealth in the largest mega-cap equities, accelerating the advantages they already have, boosting R&D investment, and facilitating their ability to acquire any companies that would compete with them.*

5. **As Result, Portfolios Tilting Mega-Cap Will OutPerform.** My argument, then, is that in the coming years and decades, it seems like portfolios that *tilt toward the largest mega-cap stocks* are likely to *outperform* the portfolios lacking such a tilt.

**Please destroy my argument with logic. I’d love to understand why I am wrong.**

So my question is, should I adjust the 403B to 10% so I can put some more focus on the Roth and max it out? Or should I just keep everything the same and still add to the Roth on occasion even if I don't max it out?",5,8,2025-05-11 23:07:09
biotechplays,Biotech Monthly Discussion: December 2024,"Well, that was a long neglectful period of not posting here. Sorry! Let's talk about stuff

There are some remaining catalysts this year, still! [Michelle Solly](https://twitter.com/MSollender/status/1841060373140541551) on Twitter has a pretty solid list of what's up in late 2024. [Sportsbios](https://twitter.com/Sports_bios/status/1863234779992461368) also has some interesting takes on some upcoming biotech catalysts worth reading. There are still plenty of interesting catalysts left. Let's talk about some of them!

$GALT -- This company is reading out a P3 for NASH cirrhosis, particularly for the slowing of the development of esophageal varices. This is going to be a long post, so I'll just say I have little to add that you can't find on [this fantastic writeup](https://biomusings.substack.com/p/galt-short) or [that fantastic writeup](https://biotenic.substack.com/p/galt-short-ph2b-navigate-data-december). I am not bullish, and judging by how expensive January puts are, I am not alone.

$GHRS/$CMPS -- This is an interesting quarter for psychedelics, especially with the new administration coming in possibly lowering the bar for them. $CMPS plans on reading out their Phase 3 for the treatment of depression with magic mushrooms this quarter, and $GHRS is reading out Phase 2s for their treatment of two types of depression with 5MeO-DMT (aka the psychedelic you get from licking toads.) Both have the issue that have plagued psychedelics and was a huge factor in [ecstacy treating PTSD](https://www.science.org/content/article/fda-rejected-mdma-assisted-ptsd-therapy-other-psychedelics-firms-intend-avoid-fate) getting rejected by the FDA earlier this year. How on earth do you get a placebo for a trial like this that demonstrates the drug is working? Either way, will be fun to get more data on how effective tripping balls is on treating depression.

$EWTX -- This one has surprisingly squeaked under the radar. Edgewise has a P2 readout for their drug treating Becker muscular dystrophy. This is an indication with zero FDA approved treatments. Earlier this year, in an open label trial, patients on the drug had improved their functionality on the NSAA scale to a notable level vs historical controls. We'll see how they perform vs placebo later this month. If so, it's an exciting >$1B opportunity and some much needed good PR for biotech.

$SAVA -- Just kidding, this already happened. Their Alzheimer's drug failed. The end of easily the most entertaining stock story of all time. For the full story, look under Findings for AlzForum's profile of [simufilam](https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/simufilam). It of course misses highlights like $SAVA suing the shorts for pointing out data fraud, shareholders filing [Citizens Petitions](https://www.chemdiv.com/company/media/pharma-news/2023/fda-denies-petition-to-grant-simufilam-breakthrough-designation/) and creating [misleading](https://twitter.com/LogarithmicDis/status/1863470950743994379) [short films](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEl6SbXR5hc) to promote it. I'll stop here before I add twenty more sentences. I love this stock cult, and I'm going to miss it. I can only hope that one day it'll get the retrospective it deserves, maybe a book or a movie.

Oh, right. We got a new president! In January, we'll get a new guy in the Oval Office who will probably embolden big corporations, which seems pretty good for pharma. He already has a pick for FDA commish that seems pretty by the book. However, his pick for HHS is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a crazy person who hates every vaccine and sees the FDA as an evil institution for holding back things like raw (unpasteurized) milk from the public. I guess a way to see this as bullish is that he plans to weaken the FDA making it easier for drugs to pass, especially psychedelics? Great news for $CMPS, $MNMD, $GHRS, and other psychs! If he gets the job in the first place, that is.

There's an H5N1 crisis a-brewing, with hundreds of herds of cows infected, and the virus now [being detected](https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-raw-milk-raw-farm-recall-5893b7b823efcaf4389b77fc01fb0c56) in the aforementioned raw milk!

Stocks like $CDTX (which is developing a tx that can treat many flu strains including this one), $DNA (which is developing testing kits for H5N1), and $COCP (also developing a flu tx with data in late 24/early 25(!), h/t roloboat) should be on your watchlist as more information comes in.",16,2,2024-12-07 09:39:13

TORONTO and HAIFA, Israel, May 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NurExone Biologic Inc. (TSXV: NRX) (OTCQB: NRXBF) (FSE: J90) (“**NurExone**” or the “**Company**”), a preclinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering exosome-based therapies for central nervous system injuries, is pleased to announce that its preclinical data on optic nerve regeneration study was presented today at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (“**ARVO**) in Salt Lake City Utah, the world's largest and most respected vision science conference.

The data, presented by Prof. Ygal Rotenstreich, lead investigator and Director of the Retinal Research Lab at Sheba Medical Center, showed that ExoPTEN restored retinal activity and improved optic nerve structure in a controlled rat model of optic nerve compression. The study, initially announced in [July](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=IXsXXWkQ1zt_qipBmJcujW2N61t7QEN-RIzzNfKYIvgV_SCek48JuPwsfR0FqwqumITgj8mdKp2Z3v61QPAwWGZwdUoOOqlbAjNn3xmaOuboWPHPbAiILPBKKyYstN_KnoR-ekbnLwkbgMVpPB90w5TCwzxJGzP5oNzV3Wxuv6Snlw7uSpzu-eE4bLQ7erV55ug9akx5O2T-Xyo5G23WAkM6YRqmHzFvqggUdebgQ3Ka9nd8mkTTI5GxIChnwtsXN9eg02NXYFzblHZCEhjPZm_be1kaYD1FhxcPh5GmDiE=) and [December 2024](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wr1yiW1wm-uWvd58qlLn1omtdO53lPk_rY1nIsjbH7bQlqul4pCoz1w5i7GXz7IKX7zjgwtantEg58kofd5vNqn34YwCxfWQQt4zwr85OS_BZfZ7EIayjmDEJLNikLk-MIqrLuCNg076U9-STwi7fHHgcUuzdLI033sodWSSpw8SWU7YgxpusLuBiyPezlkyn4vPsmrq8ENOHHNnLmKJ-Ci1OZDqho_56nStKXGnlM-9za1I8gutIpx_9k8nyBfBusxNjE6rcbU6xZtpxFuP4g==), has since been expanded to include a larger group of animals.

Prof. Ygal Rotenstreich commented “We’re proud to present this progress in optic nerve regeneration at ARVO, where the future of vision science is shaped”. He further noted “Our presentation generated a lot of interest from our peers and the scientific community who are anxiously awaiting real breakthroughs in this field.

Prof. Michael Belkin, founder of Tel Aviv University's Goldschleger Eye Research Institute where the study took place and a member of NurExone’s Scientific Advisory Board, noted “The results presented at ARVO show a distinct possibility that ExoPTEN can be used in treating optic nerve pathologies. We are proceeding to study an actual glaucoma model to examine the possibility of treating optic nerves which cause vision incapacitation from this common disease.”

Dr. Lior Shaltiel, CEO of NurExone also added “We’re seeing damaged neurons survive and regain function in models that were previously considered irreversible, challenging long-standing assumptions in neurodegeneration. Acute glaucoma carries a high risk of irreversible blindness and an associated economic burden that costs the healthcare system billions per year^(1). By preserving vision in even a fraction of these cases, a therapy, like ExoPTEN, could deliver clinical and economic value.”

The therapy for acute glaucoma is being developed as part of NurExone’s broader ExoTherapy™ platform, which also includes programs for spinal cord and facial nerve regeneration. In preclinical spinal cord studies, ExoPTEN restored motor function in 75% of animals following complete transection. Like its ophthalmic applications, the spinal and facial nerve programs use the same exosome-based product, supporting a modular and scalable approach to nervous system repair.

The ARVO Annual Meeting is the largest and most respected gathering in vision research, bringing together over 10,000 experts from academia, industry, and clinical practice. NurExone’s inclusion in the ARVO scientific program reflects growing recognition of exosome-based strategies as a potential new frontier in regenerative medicine.

biotechplays,NurExone Biologic (NRX): A Biotech Stock Turning Heads in 2025,"NurExone Biologic Inc. (TSXV: NRX, OTCQB: NRXBF), an Israeli-based biopharmaceutical innovator, is generating growing interest among biotech investors thanks to its pioneering approach to treating traumatic neurological injuries. Using proprietary exosome-based delivery technology, NurExone (NRX) is entering a new phase of clinical readiness while positioning itself as a key player in the evolving regenerative medicine market.

**A New Frontier in Spinal Cord Injury Treatment**

NurExone’s (NRX) flagship candidate, **ExoPTEN**, is a non-invasive intranasal therapy designed to treat acute spinal cord injuries (SCI). It harnesses exosomes—naturally occurring nano-vesicles that can deliver therapeutic proteins and genetic materials to targeted cells in the central nervous system. This platform represents a shift from invasive and risky surgical interventions to a safer, scalable, and more targeted delivery method.

In preclinical studies published by the company and referenced in their official presentations, ExoPTEN restored motor function and bladder control in approximately 75% of treated lab animals. Encouraged by these findings, the company is preparing to file an **Investigational New Drug (IND)** application with the FDA for human clinical trials, a significant milestone that could unlock further value for NurExone (NRX).

**Expanding the Pipeline Beyond SCI**

NurExone (NRX) isn’t stopping at spinal cord injury. Its **ExoTherapy platform** is being evaluated for multiple other indications including:

* **Optic nerve regeneration**, with promising results mentioned in their January 2024 press release.
* **Facial nerve damage**, shown in early-stage preclinical models.
* **Traumatic brain injury (TBI)**, flagged in their investor deck as a future target for pipeline expansion.

These programs are still in the research phase, but early results support the company’s thesis that exosome-based drug delivery can revolutionize how we treat damage to the nervous system.

**Building a North American Foothold**

In February 2025, NurExone (NRX) publicly announced the formation of **Exo-Top Inc.**, a U.S. subsidiary tasked with manufacturing and commercializing exosome therapies. Leading the charge is newly appointed executive Jacob Licht, as confirmed in the company’s February press release.

Just weeks later, NurExone (NRX) reported raising **C$2.3 million** through a private placement, disclosed via a newswire statement, to support ExoPTEN’s clinical pathway and build a GMP-compliant production facility in the United States.

“This capital allows us to move from research to execution,” said CEO Lior Shaltiel in a publicly available statement. “We are entering the next phase of our journey toward regulatory and commercial milestones.”

**Market Sentiment: Gaining Traction**

Despite broader biotech volatility, NurExone (NRX) has maintained upward momentum:

* **Stock Price**: As of early May 2025, shares are trading around **CA$0.70**, according to data from Yahoo Finance.
* **Analyst Target**: Public sources including Simply Wall St and Fintel have shown one-year targets averaging **CA$2.10**—nearly **200% upside** potential.
* **Momentum**: Trading platforms such as TradingView display positive technical indicators for NRXBF.

NurExone’s (NRX) inclusion in the **2025 TSX Venture 50™**, officially announced by the TSX Venture Exchange, highlights its role as one of the exchange’s top-performing companies.

**How It Stands Against the Competition**

Unlike traditional biotech companies relying on synthetic molecules or monoclonal antibodies, NurExone’s (NRX) unique exosome approach is drawing market attention. Peer companies like **Regenxbio**(NASDAQ: RGNX), **Athersys** (OTC: ATHXQ), and **BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics** (NASDAQ: BCLI) are developing therapies for neurological conditions, but most do not utilize the same non-invasive exosome-based delivery mechanism.

NurExone’s early-stage valuation may present an asymmetric opportunity compared to these later-stage firms with larger market caps.

**Final Thoughts: A Speculative Buy with Strong Fundamentals**

NurExone (NRX) is still in the early innings of clinical development, and biotech investing always carries inherent risk. That said, its unique approach, strong preclinical data, increasing investor traction, and strategic North American expansion make it one of the more intriguing small-cap biotech plays of 2025.

With the right clinical milestones, NurExone (NRX) could become a breakout story in the regenerative medicine space. Investors looking for innovative disruption in biotech may want to keep this ticker—NRX—on their radar.",1,0,2025-05-06 17:28:38

biotechplays,Nurexone Biologics: Exosome Therapy on the Cutting Edge of Nerve Regeneration,"# Introduction

Nurexone Biologics is a preclinical-stage biotech company pioneering exosome-based therapies for neural injury repair. By harnessing tiny cell-derived vesicles called exosomes as natural delivery vehicles, Nurexone aims to regenerate damaged nerves in conditions like spinal cord injuries, glaucoma-related optic nerve damage, and facial nerve paralysis – areas with huge unmet medical needs. Success in this approach could revolutionize treatment for these conditions, opening up significant clinical and commercial opportunities for the company in the coming decade.

# What Are Exosomes and Why Do They Matter in Regenerative Medicine?

Exosomes are nano-sized, membrane-bound vesicles released by cells into body fluids. They carry bioactive cargo – DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids – that facilitate intercellular communication. Scientists have discovered that these tiny packets hold much of the regenerative potential of stem cells, meaning exosomes can convey healing signals to injured tissues without needing to transplant whole cells. Crucially, exosomes can be engineered to deliver therapeutic molecules (such as drugs or RNA) directly to target cells and even cross protective barriers like the blood-brain barrier. This makes them an ideal platform for regenerative medicine: they are inherently biocompatible, can be administered minimally-invasively (e.g. via nasal spray), and cause lower immune rejection risk than cell grafts.

In recent years, exosome-based therapeutics have gained momentum with dozens of companies in R&D, yet there are currently no FDA-approved exosome therapies. Nurexone is positioning itself at the forefront of this emerging field by using exosomes to deliver gene-silencing therapeutics that trigger nerve regrowth. If successful, Nurexone’s exosome platform (branded “ExoTherapy”) could not only address previously untreatable nerve damage but also give the company a first-mover advantage in a nascent market.

# Large Unmet Needs: Market Overview for Spinal Cord Injury, Glaucoma, and Facial Nerve Damage

Nurexone’s three target indications represent multi-billion-dollar markets with substantial growth expected as populations age and better therapies are sought. Below is an overview of the market size and growth projections for each indication:

* Spinal Cord Injury (SCI): The global SCI treatment market is estimated at around $7.2 billion in 2024, and is projected to reach $11.94 billion by 2034, growing at a \~5.4% CAGR over the decade. This reflects the high cost and lifelong care needs of SCI patients. Currently, there is no cure for paralysis caused by SCI – less than 1% of patients achieve full neurological recovery – so new regenerative treatments could transform this space.
* Glaucoma (Optic Nerve Injury): The glaucoma treatment market (focused mostly on drugs to lower eye pressure) was $8.7 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to about $12.26 billion by 2034 (approximately 4.5% CAGR from 2025–2034). Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally, affecting over 80 million people. Existing therapies help slow vision loss by reducing optic nerve damage, but they cannot restore lost vision – highlighting a critical unmet need for nerve-regenerative approaches.
* Facial Nerve Damage (Facial Paralysis): The market for treating facial paralysis (e.g. Bell’s palsy, facial nerve injuries) is smaller but still significant, estimated at $2.5–2.7 billion in 2024 and forecasted to reach roughly $4.4 billion by 2034 (around 4.8% CAGR). Patients with facial nerve damage can suffer permanent facial droop, pain, and disability; about 30% of Bell’s palsy and similar patients have long-term functional impairments despite current treatments. New therapies that actually repair nerve function could therefore command strong demand in this niche.

These growth figures underscore that all three target markets are large and growing, driven by aging populations, increased incidence of neurological injuries, and inadequate solutions. Nurexone’s strategy to address these conditions with one exosome-based platform could give it access to an aggregate multi-billion-dollar opportunity if its therapies reach the market.

# Nurexone’s Exosome Therapy Pipeline and Recent Developments

Nurexone’s lead therapeutic platform, ExoPTEN, is an exosome loaded with a proprietary siRNA payload that suppresses the PTEN gene – a molecular brake that normally limits nerve fiber regrowth. By silencing PTEN in injured neurons, ExoPTEN aims to unleash the body’s capacity to regrow axons and repair neural circuits. Uniquely, the exosomes are delivered intranasally (through the nose), enabling them to travel along the olfactory nerve pathways and reach the brain or spinal cord injury site non-invasively. This approach has shown striking preclinical results across multiple models:

* Spinal Cord Injury: ExoPTEN has demonstrated unprecedented recovery in rodent models of acute SCI. In two independent, validated SCI studies, rats treated with intranasal ExoPTEN showed significant improvements in motor function, sensory response, and even structural nerve repair compared to controls. Over 75% of ExoPTEN-treated rats regained motor function, and in some cases of completely severed spinal cords, previously paraplegic animals recovered the ability to walk. These outcomes, achieved weeks after paralysis, suggest ExoPTEN can spur meaningful neural regeneration where few if any options exist. Nurexone has leveraged these results to obtain Orphan Drug Designation from both the U.S. FDA and EMA for ExoPTEN in acute spinal cord injury, which can provide regulatory incentives and expedited review. The company is now preparing to file an IND application (Investigational New Drug) to begin human trials in acute SCI, with Phase 1 expected to start by late 2025.
* Optic Nerve Injury (Glaucoma): Building on its SCI success, Nurexone expanded ExoPTEN’s testing to optic nerve damage, the underlying cause of vision loss in glaucoma. In late 2024, the company announced that ExoPTEN produced functional restoration of vision in animal models with optic nerve injury. Treated subjects showed visual recovery approaching normal levels in preclinical tests, whereas untreated ones suffered permanent vision deficits. This is a breakthrough finding – current glaucoma therapies only slow degeneration but do not regenerate the optic nerve. Nurexone’s data suggest ExoPTEN could become the first therapy to actually reverse some of the damage of glaucoma. The company views this as a promising new pathway to treat a disease affecting millions, and it has made optic nerve regeneration (glaucoma) its second core indication.
* Facial Nerve Regeneration: In April 2025, Nurexone unveiled ExoPTEN’s efficacy in a third indication – peripheral facial nerve injury. At the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) conference, the company presented preclinical evidence that ExoPTEN can promote robust regeneration of injured facial nerves, leading to restored function in a rat model. This is the first time an exosome therapy has been shown to heal peripheral nerve damage like that seen in Bell’s palsy or Ramsay Hunt syndrome. The treated animals recovered facial muscle movement and symmetry, whereas untreated subjects had lasting paralysis. Given that a substantial subset of patients with facial nerve palsy suffer permanent deficits even after standard care, ExoPTEN could fill a major gap in therapy. Nurexone estimates this new indication opens up a third multi-billion dollar addressable market for the company. Notably, all three indications – spinal cord, optic nerve, and facial nerve – are being addressed with the same ExoPTEN drug, simply applied to different targets. This highlights ExoPTEN’s versatility in stimulating nerve repair across the central and peripheral nervous system.

The rapid expansion of Nurexone’s pipeline from one to three indications in just a couple of years speaks to the platform nature of its exosome therapy. As R&D Director Dr. Tali Kizhner noted, “We have shown three indications which can be addressed by the same ExoPTEN drug. A single manufacturing process serving multiple high-value indications significantly enhances the economic model.” In other words, Nurexone can invest in one production process for exosomes and one core drug product, yet potentially treat multiple diseases – a cost-efficient model for a small biotech. This multi-indication approach also de-risks the pipeline to some extent: even if one indication faces setbacks, others could still advance using the same core technology.

# Strategic Positioning and Future Outlook

Nurexone is strategically positioned as a pioneer in exosome-based regenerative medicine for neurological injuries. The company benefits from several key advantages:

* First-Mover Advantage with Novel Technology: With no approved exosome therapies on the market yet, Nurexone aims to be among the first to bring such a product into clinical trials. Its focus on acute spinal cord injury – an area with no effective drugs – could fast-track ExoPTEN’s development under orphan status and yield transformative results for patients. Positive human data in SCI would not only validate Nurexone’s platform but also set the stage for expansion into glaucoma and facial nerve indications where competition is minimal for regenerative solutions.
* Robust Intellectual Property: The ExoPTEN technology is built on research from the Technion – Israel’s Institute of Technology – and Nurexone holds a worldwide exclusive license to the underlying patents. A U.S. patent has been granted (with others granted in Japan, Russia, Israel and pending elsewhere) covering exosome-based PTEN inhibition for nerve repair. This IP position gives Nurexone freedom to operate and the ability to defend its platform across major markets as it moves towards commercialization.
* Multiple Shots on Goal: By pursuing three related indications in parallel, Nurexone diversifies its opportunities. Each target market (SCI, glaucoma, facial paralysis) is large in its own right, and success in any one could justify the platform. Yet the common therapeutic approach (ExoPTEN) means R&D efforts are synergistic. Manufacturing scale-up for one indication can serve others, and regulatory designations like Orphan Drug for SCI may aid in discussions for optic and facial nerve trials as well. The company’s recent achievements – Orphan designations granted, pre-IND meetings with FDA completed, and a growing body of peer-reviewed preclinical data – all bolster its credibility as a serious player in regenerative biotech.
* Strategic Flexibility for Partnerships or Acquisition: As a young biotech (founded 2020 in Israel), Nurexone has a relatively lean operation (fewer than 20 employees) and will require significant capital to conduct late-stage trials. Management is likely open to partnering with larger pharma or biotech companies if ExoPTEN shows clinical promise. The high value of its target markets and the novelty of its exosome platform could attract deals – for instance, big pharma might license ExoPTEN for commercialization in spinal cord injury, or even acquire Nurexone for access to its platform, as often happens once early trials succeed. Investors can take some confidence that the exit opportunities (via partnership or M&A) are tangible if Nurexone delivers strong Phase 1/2 results.

Looking ahead, the next 12–24 months will be critical for Nurexone. Key milestones include the IND approval and first-in-human trial of ExoPTEN for acute SCI (expected to commence in late 2025), as well as further preclinical progress in glaucoma and facial nerve programs. Any early human data showing safety and signs of efficacy in spinal cord injury would be a game-changer, potentially validating exosome therapy as a new modality in medicine. Given the enormous stakes – restoring movement to paralyzed patients, vision to glaucoma sufferers, or smiles to those with facial paralysis – Nurexone’s mission has a compelling humanitarian angle alongside its commercial upside.

In summary, Nurexone Biologics has leveraged cutting-edge exosome science to build a pipeline targeting three high-impact neurological conditions. By addressing the root cause of these conditions (nerve damage) rather than just symptoms, the company’s ExoTherapy platform could dramatically improve patient outcomes where current treatments fall short. The market potential is in the tens of billions of dollars across spinal cord injuries, glaucoma, and facial nerve injuries over the next decade, giving Nurexone a sizeable runway for growth. While still early-stage, the company’s strategic focus, encouraging preclinical results, and strong IP position it well in the fast-growing regenerative medicine sector. For investors knowledgeable in biotech, Nurexone represents a bold, high-reward play: if exosome-based regeneration succeeds, Nurexone could emerge as a leader in a new era of nerve repair therapeutics.",0,0,2025-05-06 02:18:08

biotechplays,GOVX: The Next Big up runner? Biotech Might Be Where Retail Strikes Back,"Not a YOLO, but stumbled on something that piqued my interest while digging through low-float biotech plays.

GeoVax Labs (GOVX) — sub-$10M market cap, clinical-stage biotech. Yeah, microcap trash territory, but here’s the twist: they’re working on immunotherapies, cancer vaccines, and infectious disease platforms. High-risk, sure, but this is the kind of thing that either dies in a dumpster or goes vertical off a single PR or FDA nod.

What caught my eye:

	•	Tiny float (potential volatility magnet)

	•	High institutional short % (though data is patchy)

	•	Recent chatter around upcoming trial updates / partnerships

	•	Trading at near cash levels — basically priced for failure

This feels like one of those setups where if news drops, it becomes a circuit-breaker meme. Obviously could go to $0 too — this is biotech after all.

(NASDAQ: MGRX), operating as MangoRx, is a Dallas-based telemedicine company specializing in men’s health and wellness. The company offers treatments for conditions such as erectile dysfunction, hair loss, and hormone imbalances through a secure online platform, enabling consumers to consult with licensed physicians and receive medications discreetly at their doorstep.​

https://preview.redd.it/4eyrweipxcye1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c17b2d2a4cda6e2dc7aead92a525cb486c2a671

On March 25, 2025, Mangoceuticals announced it has entered into a Master Distribution Agreement to secure the exclusive licensing and distribution rights for Diabetinol® within the United States and Canada. Diabetinol® is a clinically supported and patented plant-based nutraceutical derived from citrus peel, rich in polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) like nobiletin and tangeretin. Clinical studies have demonstrated that these compounds significantly impact metabolic processes, particularly in how the body processes and utilizes sugar and fat. Mechanistically, Diabetinol® works by improving insulin sensitivity, enhancing GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake in tissues, suppressing hepatic glucose production, and activating key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. It also reduces systemic inflammation and oxidative stress—two primary biological drivers of insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. This strategic move positions Mangoceuticals to expand its product portfolio into the $33.66 billion addressable diabetes and metabolic health market. ​

Following the announcement, Mangoceuticals’ stock experienced a significant decline, closing at $2.81 on March 25, 2025, down approximately 41.68% from the previous close. Despite this drop, the company’s 52-week range has seen highs of $16.80, indicating potential volatility. The recent dip may present a buying opportunity for investors who believe in the company’s strategic direction and its expansion into the metabolic health sector. ​

Jacob Cohen, Founder and CEO of Mangoceuticals, commented on the expansion:​

“Millions of people are left on the sidelines watching others lose weight using drugs they can’t afford. Diabetinol® is not a direct substitute for those prescription therapies, but the internal studies have concluded that it does offer complementary metabolic benefits in a safe, natural, and more affordable way. By harnessing clinically proven plant-derived ingredients, we’re providing a new option for individuals who cannot access or tolerate GLP-1 medications. Our goal is to help more people take control of their blood sugar and weight – safely, conveniently, and cost-effectively.”

Mangoceuticals plans to distribute Diabetinol® in multiple consumer-friendly formats, including capsules, ready-to-drink beverages, quick-release pouches, cookies, and gummies. Distribution channels are expected to encompass direct-to-consumer online initiatives via the company’s website and through online retailers, brick-and-mortar retail outlets, and affiliate marketing channels. ​

This expansion aligns with Mangoceuticals’ mission to improve lives through safe and accessible wellness solutions, addressing the escalating diabetes crisis and the growing demand for affordable metabolic health products.​",1,0,2025-05-02 12:58:52

The company focuses on four major health sectors: hair growth, erectile function, testosterone support, and weight loss. With a commitment to delivering innovative products and solutions, MangoRx stands at the intersection of modern science and natural health, aiming to transform lives through accessible and effective treatments.

**Sector Overview: Health and Wellness Industry**

The health and wellness industry has experienced remarkable growth in recent years, driven by a global focus on proactive health management. As of 2023, the global health and wellness market was valued at approximately $5.6 trillion and is projected to reach $7.6 trillion by 2030, according to McKinsey & Company. Categories such as dietary supplements, fitness, sexual wellness, and hormone support are leading the surge. 

MangoRx (NASDAQ: MGRX) has positioned itself within this thriving sector by addressing specific and high-demand health concerns. The erectile dysfunction drug market alone was valued at $2.9 billion globally in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.2% through 2030 (Grand View Research). Meanwhile, the global hair restoration market is projected to surpass $13.5 billion by 2028 (Fortune Business Insights), and the testosterone replacement therapy market is set to exceed $2 billion by 2027 (Allied Market Research).

MangoRx’s digital presence and influencer-driven marketing have helped it reach a growing consumer base. While exact user figures are not publicly confirmed through independent sources, the brand has significantly expanded its U.S. presence and continues to attract new customers through online platforms and targeted marketing strategies. The brand’s strong alignment with consumer preferences for natural, discreet, and online-orderable health solutions makes it well-positioned in an industry that is increasingly moving toward personalization and convenience.

**MangoRx’s Solutions: Tailored for the Modern Consumer**

MangoRx’s solutions are grounded in the belief that every person deserves a personalized approach to improving their health. By focusing on four primary sectors, MangoRx has created an accessible and holistic range of products to meet the specific needs of its customers:

1. **Hair Growth**Hair loss affects an estimated 80 million people in the U.S. alone, including both men and women, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Globally, the hair restoration market is projected to reach over $13.5 billion by 2028 (Fortune Business Insights). MangoRx offers products that stimulate hair follicles, promote growth, and combat thinning using natural ingredients and proprietary blends.
2. **Erectile Function**Erectile dysfunction (ED) impacts over 30 million men in the United States, per data from the Urology Care Foundation. The global ED drug market was valued at $2.9 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow steadily. MangoRx addresses this with formulations aimed at improving blood flow, hormonal balance, and overall sexual performance.
3. **Testosterone Support**According to the American Urological Association, about 40% of men over the age of 45 have low testosterone levels. The testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) market is projected to exceed $2 billion globally by 2027 (Allied Market Research). MangoRx provides natural testosterone support supplements to improve energy, focus, libido, and muscle strength.
4. **Weight Loss**More than 70% of American adults are overweight or obese, according to the CDC, and the global weight management market is forecast to surpass $500 billion by 2030 (Grand View Research). MangoRx’s weight loss solutions are designed to enhance metabolism, support fat burning, and reduce appetite using plant-based formulations.

**Recent News Releases and Developments**

MangoRx has taken steps to enhance its offerings and market presence in recent months. One key development was the expansion of its hair growth line with new topical and supplement-based products designed to meet the rising demand for comprehensive hair restoration. The company also increased brand visibility through collaborations with wellness influencers who share its health-first mission.

In addition, MangoRx (NASDAQ: MGRX) improved its website and e-commerce experience, making it easier for customers to access personalized solutions and streamlined checkout. The company remains focused on research and development, with new clinically-backed health solutions expected in the near future.

**What Could Be Next for MangoRx?**

Looking ahead, MangoRx (NASDAQ: MGRX) is likely to widen its product line by exploring new wellness categories such as sleep support, immunity, and stress management. With a solid U.S. presence, the company may also pursue international expansion to capitalize on growing global wellness trends.

Personalized health offerings are another area of potential growth, leveraging customer feedback and data to create more targeted solutions. Lastly, MangoRx could look to form strategic alliances or acquisitions within the supplement or telehealth industries to strengthen its position and scale its operations further.

**Conclusion**

MangoRx is more than just a health company—it is a brand dedicated to enhancing lives through innovative solutions and natural products. With a focus on hair growth, erectile function, testosterone support, and weight loss, MangoRx is empowering individuals to take control of their health.

Alis intends to provide another answer. It’s offering public companies a “range of innovative and adaptive structures” to both return money to shareholders and give any residual intellectual property a chance to build value.

In each case, Alis would delist a company, place its assets in a special purpose vehicle, and disburse the vast majority of uncommitted cash to existing shareholders. However, Alis could also either sell back to certain shareholders IP they intend to develop, while retaining a small stake, or instead liquidate the assets more quickly than through a bankruptcy filing.

* BVF owned 2.1m shares 
* Stonepipe owned 870k 
* Nantahala owned 3.75m 
* Orbimed owned 2.86m

If you look at the YTD chart, VSTM spent a lot of time below $7. Securing a $75m private placement at $7 per share is a terrific move for VSTM. They could have tried to raise at lower prices in the past 6 months, but they were still able to get funds to buy shares at $7.

The $75m should provide a nice boost to their balance sheet. In the [March ER](https://investor.verastem.com/news-releases/news-release-details/verastem-oncology-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024), this was their cash position:

**MIAMI, FL / ACCESS Newswire / April 24, 2025 /** For decades, the men's health space has remained largely stagnant-held back by legacy brands offering generic solutions and treatment protocols that too often felt like quick fixes rather than genuine care. The result has been an industry shaped by stigma, limited access, and minimal innovation.

That landscape is beginning to change. **Mangoceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq:MGRX)** is taking a different approach, developing products that merge clinical rigor with user-centric design-responding to how people actually live today. With offerings that now span men's ED, hormonal balance, hair restoration, and weight loss-alongside a recently launched women's wellness platform, PeachesRx-the company is reshaping expectations across multiple health categories.

**Treatment Reimagined for Today's World**

Among the company's most notable developments is Mango, a flagship product that addresses erectile dysfunction (ED) in a way that feels more modern, discreet, and accessible. While ED remains a common issue-impacting over 70% of men at some point-treatment solutions have long felt dated, often defined by clinical detachment and social stigma.

Mango offers a sublingual, fast-dissolving tablet that delivers active compounds without the pharmacy line or blue-pill branding. The rapid-onset format avoids liver metabolism for quicker effect and a smoother user experience.

Available in two primary formulations-Sildenafil Mango and Tadalafil Mango -each product combines a proven PDE5 inhibitor with L-arginine for enhanced blood flow and oxytocin for emotional connection. This combination represents a deliberate move away from single-ingredient solutions, toward more comprehensive sexual wellness.

**Addressing Hormonal Health Through Oral TRT**

The focus on real-world practicality continues with Mangoceuticals' approach to testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). Low testosterone is often under-diagnosed or left untreated, in part because existing treatments-such as injections or topical gels-can be inconvenient, uncomfortable, or difficult to manage.

Prime by MangoRx introduces a more approachable alternative. At its core is Kyzatrex™, an FDA-approved oral testosterone capsule. Designed to deliver a consistent, daily dose without the hormonal spikes associated with other delivery methods, it offers a smoother, more manageable path to hormone balance.

Through the company's integrated telehealth platform, patients can complete lab work, consultations, and prescription fulfillment entirely from home. This ease of access helps remove longstanding barriers to care-bringing more people into the fold who may have previously felt excluded.

**Hair Loss Solutions with a Functional Edge**

As part of its broader expansion, Mangoceuticals has also entered the hair restoration market-a segment traditionally dominated by topical foams, shampoos, and overstated promises.

Grow by MangoRx is structured differently. Delivered as a mint-flavored, pharmaceutical-grade chewable, it contains a synergistic blend of minoxidil (to encourage growth), finasteride (to reduce DHT), biotin (for structure), and vitamin D3 (to support follicle health). This comprehensive stack addresses both the cause and symptoms of hair loss in a convenient daily format.

Rather than introducing another product that treats hair health as a cosmetic issue, Grow approaches it as a clinical concern with psychological and emotional dimensions. That distinction may prove significant, as the global hair restoration market surpassed $6 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 16% through 2030.

**Metabolic Health Without the Needle**

Expanding beyond core categories, Mangoceuticals has also stepped into one of the fastest-growing areas in wellness: weight management. Rather than replicating existing solutions, the company is working to reduce access barriers with two complementary approaches.

The first is Slim by MangoRx, a dissolvable sublingual tablet that delivers Semaglutide-the same GLP-1 receptor agonist found in drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. Combined with Vitamin B6, Slim offers a non-injectable, frictionless option for those looking to manage appetite and improve metabolic outcomes.

Alongside Slim, Mangoceuticals has secured exclusive rights in the U.S. and Canada to Diabetinol®, a citrus-derived nutraceutical containing nobiletin and tangeretin. These naturally occurring compounds are being explored for their potential to improve insulin sensitivity, lower glucose production, and reduce inflammation-making them a promising adjunct or alternative for those priced out of prescription GLP-1s.

**An Integrated Ecosystem, Not Just a Product Line**

Viewed together, these offerings suggest Mangoceuticals is building more than a portfolio-it's constructing a wellness infrastructure. The company's blend of telehealth, clinically relevant formulations, and lifestyle-compatible delivery formats reflects a broader ambition: to modernize personal health by design, not default.

At a time when many players in the wellness space lean heavily on branding or trend alignment, Mangoceuticals is emphasizing something else entirely: evidence-backed design, category-specific innovation, and patient-centric service.

Its long-term trajectory remains to be seen, but the early signals suggest that the company is operating from a different playbook-one focused not on rebranding old solutions, but on redefining what effective care can look like in the modern era.",1,0,2025-04-25 13:17:56

biotechplays,"Harmony Biosciences (HRMY) 2x Upside, Good Margin of Safety, Near Term Catalyst","**Thesis Summary**

Harmony Biosciences is a profitable, underappreciated CNS biotech with a cash‑flowing core asset (WAKIX) and a deep late‑stage pipeline. Even under conservative assumptions, WAKIX in narcolepsy alone covers nearly the entire enterprise value (EV), leaving the pipeline—especially ZYN002 in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS)—as free upside (topline Q3 2025). I believe a massive overreaction to an RTF from the FDA and some overhang from a previous shortseller report has made this opportunity available.

**1. WAKIX in Narcolepsy: Core Value Anchor With Extremely Conservative Assumptions**

• Revenues: $850 M in 2025; $1 B in 2026 (company guidance)

• FCF Margin: 30%

• Erosion: 40% share loss from 2027–2029 due to anticipated TAK‑861 entry

• Generic Cliff: full competition begins Jan 1, 2030 (ANDA settlement)

• Milestones: $150 M deducted

• Terminal Value: none assumed beyond 2029

• Resulting NPV: $881 M (\~62% of current \~$1.4 B EV)

**2. Pipeline Optionality (Effectively Free)**

**ZYN002 in FXS**

• RECONNECT Phase 3 readout Q3 2025

• US target \~70 K fully methylated patients

• Peak US sales: \~30% penetration × $100 K = $2.1 B

I’m a physician, and anecdotally many of my colleagues would have no problem prescribing this and explaining the CBD connotations to families.

• Risk‑adjusted at 50% PoS → NPV $700–900 M

This PoS could have been higher, but unfortunately the trial is a little bit underpowered relative to the previous >90% methylation subgroup, making the margin on a significant p value razor thin.

• Global upside could double to $1.4–1.8 B

The company has hired a CCO with global experience, signalling a willingness to market this aggressively WW

**Other Assets**

• WAKIX label expansions (PWS, DM1, IH): combined PoS‑adjusted NPV $100–300 M

• EPX‑100 in Dravet: PoS‑adjusted NPV $50–100 M

I believe they overpaid for their Dravet asset, but this is all free upside.

**3. Controversies & Risk Mitigation**

• **IH RTF:** should have been expected by the market, there was no way the FDA was going to approve their sNDA with the data they had in hand, this was a moonshot. The \~30% plunge is insane given everything else they have going on, and provides us with a nice opportunity.

• **Short‑seller report (2023):** allegations rebutted by patent defense, rising prescriptions, strong FCF margins.

• **Insider selling:** CFO and CCO sales can be explained by normal activity (and the CCO being replaced)

**4. Financials & Capital**

• 2024 Revenue: $714.7 M

• 2024 Free Cash Flow: $\~150M (\~20% margin, though with major acquisitions to build a pipeline into 2029)

• Cash Balance: \~$500 M; 340M debt; buyback capacity (150M authorized - I think the company understands it is undervalued, but has better uses for its cash in its planned developmental programs)",4,2,2025-04-21 20:16:12

biotechplays,Vaxart’s Underdog Story Is Just Getting Started – The Next Chapter Is About to Explode,"Let’s take a step back and look at the story Vaxart (VXRT) is writing.

This is not just another penny biotech. Vaxart is a disruptor. While the giants pushed traditional vaccine delivery methods, Vaxart quietly developed a revolutionary oral tablet vaccine platform — needle-free, shelf-stable, easy to distribute globally. This tech has the potential to reshape how vaccines are delivered across the world.

Yes, VXRT took a beating during the biotech downturn. But what many traders miss is that Vaxart survived. They kept innovating while others folded. Their Norovirus program is advancing. Their COVID and flu platforms are still in play. The IP is strong, the vision is intact, and the cash burn is under control compared to other biotechs.

We’re looking at a company that was once a $10+ stock with insane volume, now trading under a buck — but the fundamentals are better now than they were during the hype. The risk/reward down here is ridiculous.

What happens when one catalyst hits? Or when biotech sentiment turns? Or when someone bigger sees the value of an oral vaccine platform and wants in?

This is accumulation territory. Quiet now, but it won’t stay that way for long.

biotechplays,DD: Cereno Scientific (CRNOF) – A Biotech Sleeper With Big Potential,"**Disclosure**: *I hold shares. This is not financial advice – just a best effort to summarize the current state of Cereno Scientific as objectively and accessibly as possible.*

This is a follow-up to the DD posted about 12 months ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/s/YY6BZofeHt). Much has happened since then.

You’ve probably never heard of Cereno Scientific (https://cerenoscientific.com/). But if you’re into asymmetric biotech plays with massive upside and near-term catalysts — this is one to watch.

Cereno is a Swedish biotech company developing disease-modifying therapies for severe cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases — including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). These are progressive, often deadly conditions with limited treatment options today.

But Cereno isn’t targeting just symptom relief. Their approach is epigenetic modulation — in simple terms: turning disease-driving genes off and protective genes on. Think of it as reprogramming cells without altering the DNA itself.

**This is next-gen medicine — and Cereno already has real-world data to back it up.**

Where Are We Today?
- CS1 (lead drug) has completed a Phase IIa trial in PAH with remarkable results. 
- CS014 (second candidate) just finished Phase I and moves toward IPF. 
- CS585 is in preclinical development with anti-thrombotic potential.

Let’s be clear: in their Phase IIa, patients already on triple therapy (standard of care) improved so significantly on CS1 that one investigator reportedly contacted the company directly, shocked by the changes. One patient nearly normalized — an extremely rare event in PAH, which is a progressive disease with a life expectancy–upon diagnosis–of about 7 years.

What happened next? Doctors literally *refused to stop treatment* after the trial ended. They pushed Cereno to apply for Compassionate Use — and the FDA approved it. Several patients from the Phase IIa trial are now receiving CS1 long-term before it’s even approved.

That doesn’t happen every day.

**Recent Milestones and Upcoming Catalysts**
- Type-C FDA meeting – April 21 (this Monday): will shape the design for the Phase IIb pivotal trial.
- Readout from the Compassionate Use program (CU) – expected May–June.
- Topline data from CS014 Phase I – expected in June 2025.
- IND submission for CS1 Phase IIb – likely late Q2 or early Q3.
- Phase IIb study launch – H1 2026 is realistic.
- Several key conferences for partnership activity linked up, including Bio International (June 3–6).

**Cereno Now Trades on the US OTC Market**

As of this morning (18 April 2025), Cereno has quietly appeared on platforms like WSJ, Barron’s, TradingView, and OTCMarkets under the ticker CRNOF (see: https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CRNOF; the profile will likely get populated over the coming days). This enables American investors to buy the stock. Something several investors have been calling for during the last year or so.

Here’s the interesting part:

This OTC listing has not yet been formally communicated by the company.
But we suspect it will be publicly announced in the coming days.

**But Why Haven’t I Heard About This Yet?**

Great question. About a year ago, someone posted a detailed DD here (https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1cb8oxm/dd_cereno_has_presented_results_that_look_better/) explaining the fundamentals. It covered the leadership team (ex-AstraZeneca, ex-Abbott), the science, the platform, and the massive opportunity behind CS1 and CS014.

**Since then?**
- The Phase IIa results were strong and impressive, with clear signs of disease modifying abilities.
- FDA approved Compassionate Use.
- The pipeline has progressed.
- Talks with Big Pharma are ongoing (confirmed by the CEO).
- OTC entry quietly happened.

The company has been methodical — but clearly positioning for something bigger.

**Valuation Snapshot**
- Current market cap: ~$195M USD
- YTD return: +76.39% past 12 months, of which +49.85% the last 3 months
- Edison Group valuation: 14.2 SEK/share (~$1.3 USD) - conservative valuation to say the least 

Despite this recent rally, Cereno remains **significantly undervalued**. The stock has barely tapped into its potential, particularly in light of clinical progress, pipeline maturity, and regulatory milestones approaching in Q2 and Q3 2025.

For comparison, Sotatercept (Winrevair) — the only newly approved drug in PAH — was acquired by Merck for $11.5B USD in 2021, based on mid-stage data. Today, Cereno trades at less than 2% of that valuation, despite reporting data that surprised even the principal investigators and enabled FDA-approved Compassionate Use — a rare outcome for a Phase 2a program.

Notably, Cereno is on track to be considered best-in-class in terms of *safety and tolerability*, as reaffirmed in the recent Biostock interview with CEO Sten Sörensen and CMO Rahul Agrawal (https://youtu.be/IqLm5ZO2LYw?si=gOphhQo8Ojpllisb). This edge is expected to play a pivotal role in future partnering or licensing discussions.

That’s without factoring in:
- CS014 in IPF (massive unmet need)
- The value of CS585
- Potential expansion into other indications like thrombosis and fibrosis
- The value of long-term Compassionate Use data, which few competitors can match

**Closing Thoughts**

Cereno is shaping up to be a classic under-the-radar biotech play:
- Real clinical data — not just “promising preclinical stuff”
- A unique mechanism of action with epigenetic modulation
- Strong leadership and board, including global COPDs in cardiology
- FDA traction, clear regulatory path, and global patent protection
- Now accessible to US retail via OTC (CRNOF)

It’s early — but the pieces are coming together.

biotechplays,VXRT: Pill-based COVID vaccine buried by the system — May catalyst could revive it,"Vaxart ($VXRT) created a pill-form COVID vaccine — no needles, no cold storage, easier global distribution, and potential mucosal immunity. But despite early promise, the government halted their trial via the HHS, while injections dominated the market.

Now they have a formal review scheduled in May to determine next steps. With a reverse split on the table, the float would shrink dramatically. If the review clears them to resume, this could re-ignite interest fast — especially with such disruptive tech.

Nobody’s watching. No one’s talking. But the idea of a shelf-stable, needle-free vaccine is still powerful — especially if this review goes their way. Could be a sleeper play. Worth keeping an eye on.

biotechplays,$MUEL - Big benefactor from reshoring pharmaceutical manufacturing to the US,"**Company overview**: Paul Mueller Company, headquartered in Springfield Missouri, is a domestic manufacturer of high-quality stainless-steel tanks and related industrial processing equipment for end markets that include: pharmaceutical ingredient production (largest sector by far), dairy farming, beer/alcohol production, and chemical/energy production.

**Current play/growth driver – Reshoring of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing**:

* The Trump administration is pushing to reshore pharmaceutical manufacturing to the United States through proposed tariffs on imported drugs, aiming to incentivize companies to relocate production from countries like China and India back to the US. This strategy seeks to reduce reliance on foreign supply chains, particularly for active pharmaceutical ingredients, by making domestic production more financially viable. By bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., domestic integrators like Paul Mueller CO will benefit from increased investment and job creation. Companies like $LLY, $JNJ and $NVS have already announced multi billion dollar commitments to reshore pharmaceutical manufacturing to the US and will need to contract companies like Paul Mueller to design, build and install necessary drug manufacturing equipment.

* Several states like Missouri and Iowa, where $MUEL heavily operates in, are actively promoting the reshoring of pharmaceutical manufacturing, particularly active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), with the states awarding muti-million dollar grants and contracts to support these efforts. For example, looking at Missouri specifically, the state in association with its API Innovation Center at the University of Missouri–St. Louis announced this past February that they are aiming to reshore manufacturing for at least 25 essential medications and have announced several multi million-dollar contracts. Furthermore, several companies like Kindeva, MilliporeSigma and Boehringer Ingelheim have publicly announced their intentions to reshore drug manufacturing to the Missouri area with investments ranging from 76-100+ million.

* Some of these investments are already having an impact on Paul Muellers financials as the company has already announced accepting purchase orders totaling 120m from the pharmaceutical market in March of this year (orders that are to be completed from now until late 2026).

* The company has noticed the ongoing macroeconomic tends and is strategically growing; has announced multiple expansions to its Components Products facilities that are focused on modular construction of large pharmaceutical and processing equipment and product development.

**Key Financial metrics (FY 2024) - indicate the company has very attractive valuation metrics**:

* Revenue: $248,585,000 (8.5% growth from 2023, poised for accelerating growth given increasing reshoring efforts/macroeconomic trends)
* Net Income: $29,672,000 (41% growth from adjusted 2023)
* Market Cap: ~$234,209,250 (At $250 stock price)
* P/E Ratio: ~8.3 (Undervalued compared to industry norms of 15-25)
* EV/EBITDA: ~5.1 (Undervalued compared to industry norms of 8-12)
* Cash and Cash Equivalents: $21,169,000 (Exceeds total debt)
* Total Debt: ~$8,146,000 (Long-term + current liabilities)

**Broader impact of Tariffs**: The current administration's tariff policies could further benefit Paul Mueller even beyond its pharmaceutical manufacturing segment, particularly its farming and chemical/energy segment could also serve to significantly improve. Tariffs will make imported equipment costlier, favoring domestic manufacturers. For instance, large dairy farming companies historically benefited from cheaper imported equipment, but tariffs could shift focus back to domestic suppliers like Paul Mueller. While the tariff impacts will undoubtedly be nuanced, as tariffs could also increase costs for Paul Mueller as they heavily utilize steel as a raw good, though its domestic manufacturing base suggests net benefits.

**Stock Buyback program**: On March 31, 2025, the company announced a tender offer to repurchase up to $15 million worth of shares at $250 per share, a 25% premium over the then-current trading price of $199. This move, effective until May 7, 2025, reflects management's confidence in the future direction of the company. Furthermore, the company has done multiple stock buy backs historically to return excess cash to shareholders.

**Conclusion**: Key financials and the macroeconomic outlook indicate a significant gap between the business's intrinsic value and its current share price, even when considering that the stock price is up >200% in the past year. Reshoring of pharmaceutical manufacturing will drive continued growth. Paul Mueller Co ( $MUEL) to me seems like a great pharma adjacent long-term hold.",1,0,2025-04-18 13:50:09

This suggests a promising treatment pathway for glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally.
* **Financial Strengthening:** NurExone successfully raised approximately C$0.24 million in proceeds from the closing of a second tranche of a non-brokered private placement and warrant exercises, strengthening its financial position and supporting ongoing development initiatives, as follows: 
   * **Private Placement:** In November 2024, the Company completed a second tranche of a non-brokered private placement, issuing 231,818 units at C$0.55 per unit, raising aggregate gross proceeds of C$127 thousand. Each unit comprised one common share and one common share purchase warrant exercisable at C$0.70, subject to acceleration.
   * **Common Share Purchase Warrant Exercises:** In Q4-2024\*\*,\*\* the Company received approximately C$114 thousand from the exercise of 324,77 common share purchase warrants at C$0.35 per warrant.

**Dr. Lior Shaltiel, CEO of NurExone, stated:** “Our progress in 2024 underscores our commitment to advancing exosome-based regenerative medicine.

We remain focused on bringing transformative therapies to patients.”

**Eran Ovadya, CFO of NurExone, remarked:** “Our strong financial management and recent capital raise of C$2.3 million have provided us with the necessary resources to advance our strategic priorities - most notably, the establishment of a U.S. production facility to accelerate our drug pipeline and preparing for an uplisting to a major U.S. exchange. With our current funding, we are well-positioned to support operations and achieve key development milestones in 2025.”

**Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Results**

* Financial income/expenses, net, were US$0.03 million of expense in 2024, compared to US$0.02 million of income in 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2024, financial expenses were US$0.06 million, compared to US$0.02 million in the previous year. The change was primarily due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and interest expenses.
* Net loss for 2024 was US$5.04 million, compared to US$3.64 million in 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2024, net loss was US$1.55 million, compared to US$0.74 million in the previous year. The change is primarily reflecting increased R&D spending and corporate development activities.

Based on clinical studies performed, these compounds have demonstrated significant metabolic effects, particularly in how the body processes and utilizes sugar and fat. Mechanistically, Diabetinol^(®) works by improving insulin sensitivity, enhancing GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake in tissues, suppressing hepatic glucose production, and activating key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. It also reduces systemic inflammation and oxidative stress—two of the primary biological drivers of insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.

Under the agreement, Mangoceuticals will hold the exclusive rights to market and sell Diabetinol^(®) across the United States and Canada, expanding its product portfolio into the $33.66 billion addressable diabetes and metabolic health market.

“Millions of people are left on the sidelines watching others lose weight using drugs they can’t afford,” said Jacob Cohen, Founder and CEO of Mangoceuticals, Inc., who continued, “Diabetinol^(®) is not a direct substitute for those prescription therapies, but the internal studies have concluded that it does offer complementary metabolic benefits in a safe, natural, and more affordable way. By harnessing clinically proven plant-derived ingredients, we’re providing a new option for individuals who cannot access or tolerate GLP-1 medications. Our goal is to help more people take control of their blood sugar and weight – safely, conveniently, and cost-effectively.”

Mangoceuticals’ expansion into metabolic health is timely given the escalating diabetes crisis and the enormous total addressable market for such solutions. In the U.S. alone, over 30 million Americans suffer from type 2 diabetes, and approximately 97.6 million American adults—more than one in three—have prediabetes. Globally, an estimated 537 million adults are currently living with diabetes, and that number is expected to rise to 783 million by 2045. If current trends continue, projections suggest it could exceed 1.3 billion by 2050.

The healthcare burden associated with this is immense. U.S. diabetes-related healthcare costs are already over $400 billion per year. Meanwhile, global spending on weight loss and blood sugar–lowering medications reached $24 billion in 2023 and is projected to surpass $131 billion by 2028. Currently, many people are prescribed metformin yet discontinue second-line therapies due to cost or tolerability. With an estimated 50% of Americans actively trying to lose weight at any given time, the demand for safer, more affordable metabolic health solutions is surging.

We believe that Diabetinol^(®) is well-positioned to fill that gap. As a naturally derived, clinically supported nutraceutical, it offers a compelling option for consumers who either can’t tolerate or access GLP-1 drugs, or who are seeking to support their health with a non-pharmaceutical approach.

Mangoceuticals intends to distribute Diabetinol^(®) in multiple consumer-friendly formats including capsules, a ready-to-drink beverage, quick-release pouches, cookies, and gummies. Each product will be carefully dosed to deliver consistent clinical levels of Diabetinol’s active ingredients. Distribution is expected to include direct-to-consumer online initiatives via our own website and through online retailers, brick and mortar retail outlets, and affiliate marketing channels.

Najla Guthrie, Founder of KGK Synergize and a recognized leader in nutraceutical clinical research, expressed strong support for Diabetinol’s role in addressing metabolic dysfunction, “I believe that Diabetinol^(®) has the potential to revolutionize how we think about supporting metabolic health. Its unique blend of natural citrus-derived compounds has been shown to deliver meaningful improvements in glycemic control, lipid profiles, and blood pressure—offering a safe and clinically validated adjunct to conventional care for those with prediabetes or diabetes,” said Guthrie. She further noted that Diabetinol’s formulation, centered around compounds like nobiletin and tangeretin, has been shown in rigorous clinical trials to improve glucose tolerance and lipid levels without adverse impacts on liver, kidney, or other organ functions and believes that these findings support Diabetinol as a safe, science-backed option to help manage blood sugar and reduce risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease.

Mr. Cohen further added, “Obtaining the exclusive rights to Diabetinol is a major milestone for Mangoceuticals. We are proud to introduce an innovative, science-backed nutraceutical that aligns with our mission of improving lives through safe and accessible wellness solutions. Diabetinol’s arrival could not be more timely, as the world faces a metabolic health epidemic and we have seen that patients are seeking alternatives that are both effective and affordable. We believe Diabetinol^(®) can become an invaluable option for individuals looking to take charge of their metabolic health, and we’re excited to lead that charge.”

In recent years, there has been growing public awareness around the need for cleaner, more natural approaches to health and wellness. Leaders in the national health conversation, including newly appointed United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have emphasized the importance of reducing reliance on synthetic pharmaceuticals in favor of preventive, plant-based solutions, where appropriate. We believe that Diabetinol^(®) reflects this shift—offering a science-backed, naturally derived option for those seeking to support their metabolic health with fewer chemicals and greater transparency.

**About Diabetinol\*\*\*\*****^(®)** **Clinical Studies**

In a 3-month pilot study involving participants with impaired glucose metabolism, Diabetinol^(®) was shown to reduce peak postprandial blood glucose by approximately 50 mg/dL following a glucose challenge test. This reduction is considered clinically meaningful, as it eases the burden on pancreatic beta cells and lowers the risk of long-term damage caused by repeated glucose spikes. Diabetinol^(®) helped participants stabilize blood sugar responses after meals, which is essential for preserving insulin function and preventing complications associated with hyperglycemia.

In a 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes who were already on conventional medications, Diabetinol^(®) was shown to significantly improve a range of health markers. Among those taking Diabetinol^(®), 14.3% reached Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) targets (compared to 0% of the placebo group), 33.3% reached LDL cholesterol goals (vs. 15.4% placebo), 20% reached total cholesterol goals (vs. 12.5% placebo), and 83.3% reached systolic blood pressure goals (vs. 60% placebo). Participants also experienced improved glucose tolerance over time, with a slower rise in fasting glucose levels and improved Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) profiles—especially in individuals aged 40 to 60.

They have two seasons: war and peace. They make money in peacetime and make crazy money in times of war. That’s a good business cycle to be subject to.

Several changes based on feedback from last years survey. Some that I'm excited about:

* Location responses are now multiple choice instead of free-form text. Now it should be easier to analyze data by country, state, city
* Added a ""department"" question in attempt to categorize jobs based on their larger function
* In general, some small tweeks to make sure responses are more specific so that data is more interpretable (e.g. currency for the non-US folk, YOE and education are more specific to delimit years in academia vs industry and at current job, etc.)

As always, please continue to leave feedback. **Although not required, please consider adding company name** especially if you are part of a large company (harder to dox)

biotech,Donald’s actions - a 1-2 punch to biotech?!?,"It seems that biotech can’t catch any kind of break recently!

First, Donald and his appointees go to work dismantling NIH and holding biomedical research grants as leverage against universities. 

Then, today, Donald announces a ruthless effort to slash drug prices in US based on ‘favored nation status’. 

The first action will stunt innovation and wellspring of innovative therapies or therapeutic insights from academia. Also, it will stunt the future worker population in biotech. Nearly every quality PhD, Master’s or even Medical leader in biotech has relied on NIH related funding as part of their training prior to joining the biotech industry.

On slashing drug costs - while it’s a long overdue effort, Donald’s proposal could completely gut pharma & biotech profits, and leave many biotechs with no commercial viability in their lead assets. 
An unspoken truth with biotech in US is that companies generate the vast majority of their profits from sales in US, because of the largely laissez faire system of drug pricing in US. 
Because nearly every other developed nation has national drug pricing negotiation, it’s not as though pharma/biotech companies could just raise prices outside the US to make up for any cuts in US pricing.

Add to all this a general anti-science bias that shuns vaccines (and actively promotes anti-vax ideology) and MAHA (make America healthy again) mantra and idea of shunning medications in general, makes for a challenging environment to develop and sell therapies in US. 

What do others think? Are dire times ahead as a result of current admin actions?

biotech,R&D Exit Opportunities,"I’m currently a research scientist in pharma, based in the UK. I’m on the chemistry side of things, following a PhD in Chemistry.

I’ve enjoyed my job so far however there’s always a couple of concerns:
- Salary in UK for science is, quite frankly, shit for the experience/education you need.
- Lack of established pharma R&D which leads to huge competition for very few jobs.
- The constant anxiety about reorganisations/layoffs, which in turn makes everything more competitive
- Benchwork is frankly becoming boring and I wish I had more flexibility in terms of hybrid/WFH.

R&D is an expensive department and tariffs, AI, outsourcing are all threats, as is big pharma simply buying assets instead of making them in-house. This has led me to question the security of my career in R&D, and I’m wondering whether it’s something I can survive in for the long-term.

So, I’ve gone through this sub and other subs to try and find career paths R&D scientists take to leave R&D. I love science and research but I want to use my technical knowledge/interest outside of R&D.

Some things I’ve seen are:
- Life science consultancy
- Regulatory affairs
- Medical affairs
- Medical science liaisons
- Project management
- Patent attorneys (huge shift!)

I wanted to get the opinions of those of you in those sub who left R&D, about what career path you took, and:
- What made you leave
- What did you move into
- Have you enjoyed the shift

From the list, reg/medical affairs seems interesting to me from a career/science balance POV, whilst patents seems very stable and lucrative.

biotech,Is the cell and gene therapy bubble bursting and where to go from here?,"I've been seeing Vor Bio's CSO sharing posts from his employees seeking new jobs, and it's gotten me thinking about where cell and gene therapy is headed. Vor Bio's approach—knocking out CD33 in hematopoietic stem cells, transplanting them into AML patients, then targeting CD33 on leukemic cells—seemed scientifically sound. Unlike more ambitious claims (like inserting any genetic sequence anywhere), this was straightforward. Yet, despite the solid premise, Vor shut down after negative clinical data.

Vor isn’t alone; numerous companies have folded after entering clinical trials or even earlier. Failures related to scaling or manufacturing are understandable since those issues typically surface only at industrial scale. However, when failure stems from the fundamental scientific hypothesis—the inability to reproduce the founders’ high-profile Nature paper, for example, it highlights a deeper, systemic issue.

I've personally experienced situations where companies couldn’t reproduce even basic positive results from preclinical models, despite claims made during funding rounds. Many peers have shared similar stories. This makes me wonder: how do such flawed ideas make it past rigorous - I assume- VC evaluations? Could better scientific oversight from VCs prevent millions from being wasted?  

Another puzzling aspect is the endgame for these founders. They must realize their products might never reach the market. Then it struck me: it might simply be a career strategy. Jumping from an academic or postdoc salary ($70–150K/year) to an executive role ($300–400K/year) for several years can substantially boost one's career and financial status. Post-company, many transition into investment banking or research equity roles, possibly even launching another startup. After all, (this is how science work), and no one blames you if the science doesn't pan out.

I’m worried the apprenticeship won’t be viewed as academic enough , or not as prestigious by PhD supervisors. Does anyone have experience with this?",0,1,2025-05-12 12:33:33
biotech,Built a site to help biotech teams review CDMO/CRO partners — would love feedback,"I recently built a website where biotech teams can find and leave reviews for CRO and CDMO partners.

After working on the software side of the industry, I kept seeing how much risk goes into finding and vetting the right manufacturing or research partner. I know it’s nuanced and is never going to be a perfectly smooth process, but I do think that finding a service partner could be a lot easier if more experiences were shared openly. The goal of this site is to help teams make better decisions with less guesswork. I’m coming at this from a software developer’s perspective, so any thoughts on what info should be shown would really help me make this site more useful. Here is the rough draft: [www.biotechservicefinder.com](http://www.biotechservicefinder.com)

I’m still working on building out the data, and wondering what would be most useful for you all to see when choosing a partner. I'm considering adding in FDA warning letters or other regulatory specifics that would help with due diligence.

On a personal note - I have family in academia, so if I’m not someone doing research and development, I want to build tools that help speed up the process.

Would love any feedback from this community on ideas, critiques, or things you wish a resource like this could do. Feel free to hit my DMs as well and thanks for your advice.",0,4,2025-05-12 18:30:01

biotech,Career Advice: Switching back to Biotech from IT,"Hello!
I graduated in biotechnology engineering. 
During the course, I realized wet lab works—especially microbiology—just wasn’t for me. On the other hand, I really liked the dry lab and computational (especially SAS) parts. After graduation, I ended up switching to IT because there weren’t many opportunities in biotech and another option available to me was to go for higher studies. But I didn't want to go for higher studies as I had not figured out my interests clearly. 

The IT job was tough in the beginning, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly. It’s been about two years now, but lately I’ve been feeling kind of bored with it. I keep thinking about how I moved away from biotech and regret doing it and part of me really wants to go back to  Biotech - just not the lab work. 

Currenty,  I’m interested in switching back into something more aligned with biotech, ideally something that combines it with my current IT experience as i don't want this experience go into waste, but I’m not exactly sure how to go about it—and I don’t want those two years in IT to feel like a waste. So yeah, I’m just a bit lost and confused at the moment. 

I’d really appreciate any advice or guidance on how to navigate this or what options I should explore.

Thanks.

biotech,"How to improve my resume, if I don't have linear career trajectories","I created another post asking about some suggestions on how to overcome some weird career progression in the past, but I didn't include my resume. So let me try again. 

For context, in theory, I should have about 8 years post-PhD experiences: 2 years of academic postdoc, it wasn't very successful, so I decided to leave and moved into some IT companies (non-biotech) for 2.5 years (learned some new skills and also leadership experiences). Then, I missed biotech, but it was Covid. Couldn't get a better job, I decided to do another academic postdoc for 2.5 years. Last year, I got a job in a pharma company, but when I got the offer, they did not consider my experiences (because of academic positions and/or outside of the US industrial experiences), so they offered a position below what I was applying for. I was desperate so I took the offer anyway, but It turns out a total chaos.

If you were me, how would you structure your resume? Can you point anything that that can still be improved?  I sent out many applications, but either immediately rejected or didn't hear back at all. I feel like something wrong with my resume, or it is just not competitive enough. Also, I am tryng to secure some positions along the line of research and discovery (synthetic biology, high throughput screening, automation). Thanks for any feedback and suggestions.

biotech,MSc dissertation defense,"I'm about to defend my dissertation but all ofy plans were terribly ruined.
My first project was to evaluate thru qPCR and rnaseq the osteoinductive and osteoconductive potencial of a hydrogel based on natural polysaccharide in mesenchymal stem cells.
But, not content with this project, I've talked to my advisor and we agreed in incorporate a flavonoid in the hydrogel matrix, and evaluate not only the osteogenic potencial on MSC but also the immunomodulatory effect on periotneal macrophages.
Ends up, my laboratory had all the technical problems you all can imagine and we had to stop all experiments for 1 whole year.
Now, the only result I got are: the Raman spectra of the hydrogel pure and the hydrogel with the flavonoid. Biocompatibility tests of the pure hydrogel (MTT, hemolysis, nitric oxide synthesis - Griess reaction) - and, while I had nothing to do due to the lab lock, I've done some pharmacology network using the intersection of genes related to my flavonoid and genes related to osteogenesis, made some PPI and clustering, and PPI networks. Also, molecular docking of the flavonoid on important proteins for osteogenesis and immunomodulation, and ADMET to evaluate the possible behaviour of the flavonoid on the hydrogel matrix.
I know it lacks a lot of other testing, but my time is up, and that's all I got.
I've worked on my discussion in the following way: compared the Raman spectra of the pure hydrogel, the pure flavonoid and the hydrogel+flavonoid (it seems like the funtionalization went well), discussed about the biocompatibility of the pure hydrogel (from the in vitro testing), discussed a lot about the PPI network derived from the pharmacology network, emphasizing the genes with higher centrality. I've talked about each one, with comparisons and examples. The docking also went well, I've compared the energy with the agonists of each protein and they were all similar, and then, the admet supports a result that the flavonoid is good for topic administration and controlled liberation due to its pharmacokinetics properties.
I've concluded that the flavonoid in question, incorporated with the pure hydrogel, is possibly a good product for bone healing, and it needs some in vitro and in vivo testing to confirm.

biotech,PM in biotech,"I have 5 years of project management experience in tech, CROs, and now a biotech. I have a MS in biomedical sciences and a PMP. The role of the PM varied across different companies. In my current role I do not interact with the client and am mostly interacting internally and making sure projects tasks are completed on time.. as usually I often feel like a glorified secretary that schedules meetings and facilitates them but doesn’t have the authority or scientific/technical expertise to make final decisions. One aspect of project management I have always enjoyed is improving efficiencies with the different platforms and tools we use. But overall, I often struggle with the fact that I am not an expert in a certain domain and that my job is essentially useless.

To other PMs in biotech, do you feel like project management is fulfilling as a career? Do you ever feel like you aren’t an expert in anything and you are not as useful because of the lack of expertise in a specific field?",18,13,2025-05-10 13:10:48

biotech,FAS?  In this economy?,"Hi r/biotech, like many of you I am in between positions at the moment.  I was with a micro startup that, surprise surprise, couldn't raise funds and folded.  I've been a non-PHD bench scientist for almost 20 years at this point, and while I enjoy it I also can't quite see being a bench scientist at 60+ regardless of how I personally feel about it.  I'm applying an interviewing for new positions, and one of them is a FAS that will also manage some elements of BD (sales, sales support etc).  The idea of being an FAS is really appealing to me, and I think that I have some interpersonal skills that will work well for such a role.    I've read every thread I can find, but most of them are over 2 years old, so I'm asking again as things are much different in the state of our industry compared to 2022!



I guess the biggest questions on my mind are the travel requirement (50%) and career path beyond FAS.  I am just outside an east coast hub, so I imagine much of my travel will be local, but there will be plenty of travel throughout the eastern US.  For folks who have made this pivot, is it possible to balance family life with 50% travel?  I have two kids and want to be there for them.  Some portion of traveling is realistic, but living out of a suitcase is not- I'd be happy traveling within my hub 5 days a week, but spending 5 days in Texas every other week will be tough.  I will probe during interviews what the specific travel requirements will be, but I'm apprehensive so trying to get a better understanding of what I can expect.



The other is related to the future- some threads mentioned moving to product management, sales or other fields.  Have any of you made such moves, and have they paid off?  Is there long term outlook for such a move, or do most people burn out within two years?  Is there a possibility of moving to a different industry with some BD experience?",28,18,2025-05-09 22:50:56
