TORONTO and HAIFA, Israel, May 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NurExone Biologic Inc. (TSXV: NRX) (OTCQB: NRXBF) (FSE: J90) (“**NurExone**” or the “**Company**”), a preclinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering exosome-based therapies for central nervous system injuries, is pleased to announce that its preclinical data on optic nerve regeneration study was presented today at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (“**ARVO**) in Salt Lake City Utah, the world's largest and most respected vision science conference.

The data, presented by Prof. Ygal Rotenstreich, lead investigator and Director of the Retinal Research Lab at Sheba Medical Center, showed that ExoPTEN restored retinal activity and improved optic nerve structure in a controlled rat model of optic nerve compression. The study, initially announced in [July](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=IXsXXWkQ1zt_qipBmJcujW2N61t7QEN-RIzzNfKYIvgV_SCek48JuPwsfR0FqwqumITgj8mdKp2Z3v61QPAwWGZwdUoOOqlbAjNn3xmaOuboWPHPbAiILPBKKyYstN_KnoR-ekbnLwkbgMVpPB90w5TCwzxJGzP5oNzV3Wxuv6Snlw7uSpzu-eE4bLQ7erV55ug9akx5O2T-Xyo5G23WAkM6YRqmHzFvqggUdebgQ3Ka9nd8mkTTI5GxIChnwtsXN9eg02NXYFzblHZCEhjPZm_be1kaYD1FhxcPh5GmDiE=) and [December 2024](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wr1yiW1wm-uWvd58qlLn1omtdO53lPk_rY1nIsjbH7bQlqul4pCoz1w5i7GXz7IKX7zjgwtantEg58kofd5vNqn34YwCxfWQQt4zwr85OS_BZfZ7EIayjmDEJLNikLk-MIqrLuCNg076U9-STwi7fHHgcUuzdLI033sodWSSpw8SWU7YgxpusLuBiyPezlkyn4vPsmrq8ENOHHNnLmKJ-Ci1OZDqho_56nStKXGnlM-9za1I8gutIpx_9k8nyBfBusxNjE6rcbU6xZtpxFuP4g==), has since been expanded to include a larger group of animals.

Prof. Ygal Rotenstreich commented “We’re proud to present this progress in optic nerve regeneration at ARVO, where the future of vision science is shaped”. He further noted “Our presentation generated a lot of interest from our peers and the scientific community who are anxiously awaiting real breakthroughs in this field.

Prof. Michael Belkin, founder of Tel Aviv University's Goldschleger Eye Research Institute where the study took place and a member of NurExone’s Scientific Advisory Board, noted “The results presented at ARVO show a distinct possibility that ExoPTEN can be used in treating optic nerve pathologies. We are proceeding to study an actual glaucoma model to examine the possibility of treating optic nerves which cause vision incapacitation from this common disease.”

Dr. Lior Shaltiel, CEO of NurExone also added “We’re seeing damaged neurons survive and regain function in models that were previously considered irreversible, challenging long-standing assumptions in neurodegeneration. Acute glaucoma carries a high risk of irreversible blindness and an associated economic burden that costs the healthcare system billions per year^(1). By preserving vision in even a fraction of these cases, a therapy, like ExoPTEN, could deliver clinical and economic value.”

The therapy for acute glaucoma is being developed as part of NurExone’s broader ExoTherapy™ platform, which also includes programs for spinal cord and facial nerve regeneration. In preclinical spinal cord studies, ExoPTEN restored motor function in 75% of animals following complete transection. Like its ophthalmic applications, the spinal and facial nerve programs use the same exosome-based product, supporting a modular and scalable approach to nervous system repair.

The ARVO Annual Meeting is the largest and most respected gathering in vision research, bringing together over 10,000 experts from academia, industry, and clinical practice. NurExone’s inclusion in the ARVO scientific program reflects growing recognition of exosome-based strategies as a potential new frontier in regenerative medicine.

biotechplays,NurExone Biologic (NRX): A Biotech Stock Turning Heads in 2025,"NurExone Biologic Inc. (TSXV: NRX, OTCQB: NRXBF), an Israeli-based biopharmaceutical innovator, is generating growing interest among biotech investors thanks to its pioneering approach to treating traumatic neurological injuries. Using proprietary exosome-based delivery technology, NurExone (NRX) is entering a new phase of clinical readiness while positioning itself as a key player in the evolving regenerative medicine market.

**A New Frontier in Spinal Cord Injury Treatment**

NurExone’s (NRX) flagship candidate, **ExoPTEN**, is a non-invasive intranasal therapy designed to treat acute spinal cord injuries (SCI). It harnesses exosomes—naturally occurring nano-vesicles that can deliver therapeutic proteins and genetic materials to targeted cells in the central nervous system. This platform represents a shift from invasive and risky surgical interventions to a safer, scalable, and more targeted delivery method.

In preclinical studies published by the company and referenced in their official presentations, ExoPTEN restored motor function and bladder control in approximately 75% of treated lab animals. Encouraged by these findings, the company is preparing to file an **Investigational New Drug (IND)** application with the FDA for human clinical trials, a significant milestone that could unlock further value for NurExone (NRX).

**Expanding the Pipeline Beyond SCI**

NurExone (NRX) isn’t stopping at spinal cord injury. Its **ExoTherapy platform** is being evaluated for multiple other indications including:

* **Optic nerve regeneration**, with promising results mentioned in their January 2024 press release.
* **Facial nerve damage**, shown in early-stage preclinical models.
* **Traumatic brain injury (TBI)**, flagged in their investor deck as a future target for pipeline expansion.

These programs are still in the research phase, but early results support the company’s thesis that exosome-based drug delivery can revolutionize how we treat damage to the nervous system.

**Building a North American Foothold**

In February 2025, NurExone (NRX) publicly announced the formation of **Exo-Top Inc.**, a U.S. subsidiary tasked with manufacturing and commercializing exosome therapies. Leading the charge is newly appointed executive Jacob Licht, as confirmed in the company’s February press release.

Just weeks later, NurExone (NRX) reported raising **C$2.3 million** through a private placement, disclosed via a newswire statement, to support ExoPTEN’s clinical pathway and build a GMP-compliant production facility in the United States.

“This capital allows us to move from research to execution,” said CEO Lior Shaltiel in a publicly available statement. “We are entering the next phase of our journey toward regulatory and commercial milestones.”

**Market Sentiment: Gaining Traction**

Despite broader biotech volatility, NurExone (NRX) has maintained upward momentum:

* **Stock Price**: As of early May 2025, shares are trading around **CA$0.70**, according to data from Yahoo Finance.
* **Analyst Target**: Public sources including Simply Wall St and Fintel have shown one-year targets averaging **CA$2.10**—nearly **200% upside** potential.
* **Momentum**: Trading platforms such as TradingView display positive technical indicators for NRXBF.

NurExone’s (NRX) inclusion in the **2025 TSX Venture 50™**, officially announced by the TSX Venture Exchange, highlights its role as one of the exchange’s top-performing companies.

**How It Stands Against the Competition**

Unlike traditional biotech companies relying on synthetic molecules or monoclonal antibodies, NurExone’s (NRX) unique exosome approach is drawing market attention. Peer companies like **Regenxbio**(NASDAQ: RGNX), **Athersys** (OTC: ATHXQ), and **BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics** (NASDAQ: BCLI) are developing therapies for neurological conditions, but most do not utilize the same non-invasive exosome-based delivery mechanism.

NurExone’s early-stage valuation may present an asymmetric opportunity compared to these later-stage firms with larger market caps.

**Final Thoughts: A Speculative Buy with Strong Fundamentals**

NurExone (NRX) is still in the early innings of clinical development, and biotech investing always carries inherent risk. That said, its unique approach, strong preclinical data, increasing investor traction, and strategic North American expansion make it one of the more intriguing small-cap biotech plays of 2025.

With the right clinical milestones, NurExone (NRX) could become a breakout story in the regenerative medicine space. Investors looking for innovative disruption in biotech may want to keep this ticker—NRX—on their radar.",1,0,2025-05-06 17:28:38

biotechplays,Nurexone Biologics: Exosome Therapy on the Cutting Edge of Nerve Regeneration,"# Introduction

Nurexone Biologics is a preclinical-stage biotech company pioneering exosome-based therapies for neural injury repair. By harnessing tiny cell-derived vesicles called exosomes as natural delivery vehicles, Nurexone aims to regenerate damaged nerves in conditions like spinal cord injuries, glaucoma-related optic nerve damage, and facial nerve paralysis – areas with huge unmet medical needs. Success in this approach could revolutionize treatment for these conditions, opening up significant clinical and commercial opportunities for the company in the coming decade.

# What Are Exosomes and Why Do They Matter in Regenerative Medicine?

Exosomes are nano-sized, membrane-bound vesicles released by cells into body fluids. They carry bioactive cargo – DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids – that facilitate intercellular communication. Scientists have discovered that these tiny packets hold much of the regenerative potential of stem cells, meaning exosomes can convey healing signals to injured tissues without needing to transplant whole cells. Crucially, exosomes can be engineered to deliver therapeutic molecules (such as drugs or RNA) directly to target cells and even cross protective barriers like the blood-brain barrier. This makes them an ideal platform for regenerative medicine: they are inherently biocompatible, can be administered minimally-invasively (e.g. via nasal spray), and cause lower immune rejection risk than cell grafts.

In recent years, exosome-based therapeutics have gained momentum with dozens of companies in R&D, yet there are currently no FDA-approved exosome therapies. Nurexone is positioning itself at the forefront of this emerging field by using exosomes to deliver gene-silencing therapeutics that trigger nerve regrowth. If successful, Nurexone’s exosome platform (branded “ExoTherapy”) could not only address previously untreatable nerve damage but also give the company a first-mover advantage in a nascent market.

# Large Unmet Needs: Market Overview for Spinal Cord Injury, Glaucoma, and Facial Nerve Damage

Nurexone’s three target indications represent multi-billion-dollar markets with substantial growth expected as populations age and better therapies are sought. Below is an overview of the market size and growth projections for each indication:

* Spinal Cord Injury (SCI): The global SCI treatment market is estimated at around $7.2 billion in 2024, and is projected to reach $11.94 billion by 2034, growing at a \~5.4% CAGR over the decade. This reflects the high cost and lifelong care needs of SCI patients. Currently, there is no cure for paralysis caused by SCI – less than 1% of patients achieve full neurological recovery – so new regenerative treatments could transform this space.
* Glaucoma (Optic Nerve Injury): The glaucoma treatment market (focused mostly on drugs to lower eye pressure) was $8.7 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to about $12.26 billion by 2034 (approximately 4.5% CAGR from 2025–2034). Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally, affecting over 80 million people. Existing therapies help slow vision loss by reducing optic nerve damage, but they cannot restore lost vision – highlighting a critical unmet need for nerve-regenerative approaches.
* Facial Nerve Damage (Facial Paralysis): The market for treating facial paralysis (e.g. Bell’s palsy, facial nerve injuries) is smaller but still significant, estimated at $2.5–2.7 billion in 2024 and forecasted to reach roughly $4.4 billion by 2034 (around 4.8% CAGR). Patients with facial nerve damage can suffer permanent facial droop, pain, and disability; about 30% of Bell’s palsy and similar patients have long-term functional impairments despite current treatments. New therapies that actually repair nerve function could therefore command strong demand in this niche.

These growth figures underscore that all three target markets are large and growing, driven by aging populations, increased incidence of neurological injuries, and inadequate solutions. Nurexone’s strategy to address these conditions with one exosome-based platform could give it access to an aggregate multi-billion-dollar opportunity if its therapies reach the market.

# Nurexone’s Exosome Therapy Pipeline and Recent Developments

Nurexone’s lead therapeutic platform, ExoPTEN, is an exosome loaded with a proprietary siRNA payload that suppresses the PTEN gene – a molecular brake that normally limits nerve fiber regrowth. By silencing PTEN in injured neurons, ExoPTEN aims to unleash the body’s capacity to regrow axons and repair neural circuits. Uniquely, the exosomes are delivered intranasally (through the nose), enabling them to travel along the olfactory nerve pathways and reach the brain or spinal cord injury site non-invasively. This approach has shown striking preclinical results across multiple models:

* Spinal Cord Injury: ExoPTEN has demonstrated unprecedented recovery in rodent models of acute SCI. In two independent, validated SCI studies, rats treated with intranasal ExoPTEN showed significant improvements in motor function, sensory response, and even structural nerve repair compared to controls. Over 75% of ExoPTEN-treated rats regained motor function, and in some cases of completely severed spinal cords, previously paraplegic animals recovered the ability to walk. These outcomes, achieved weeks after paralysis, suggest ExoPTEN can spur meaningful neural regeneration where few if any options exist. Nurexone has leveraged these results to obtain Orphan Drug Designation from both the U.S. FDA and EMA for ExoPTEN in acute spinal cord injury, which can provide regulatory incentives and expedited review. The company is now preparing to file an IND application (Investigational New Drug) to begin human trials in acute SCI, with Phase 1 expected to start by late 2025.
* Optic Nerve Injury (Glaucoma): Building on its SCI success, Nurexone expanded ExoPTEN’s testing to optic nerve damage, the underlying cause of vision loss in glaucoma. In late 2024, the company announced that ExoPTEN produced functional restoration of vision in animal models with optic nerve injury. Treated subjects showed visual recovery approaching normal levels in preclinical tests, whereas untreated ones suffered permanent vision deficits. This is a breakthrough finding – current glaucoma therapies only slow degeneration but do not regenerate the optic nerve. Nurexone’s data suggest ExoPTEN could become the first therapy to actually reverse some of the damage of glaucoma. The company views this as a promising new pathway to treat a disease affecting millions, and it has made optic nerve regeneration (glaucoma) its second core indication.
* Facial Nerve Regeneration: In April 2025, Nurexone unveiled ExoPTEN’s efficacy in a third indication – peripheral facial nerve injury. At the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) conference, the company presented preclinical evidence that ExoPTEN can promote robust regeneration of injured facial nerves, leading to restored function in a rat model. This is the first time an exosome therapy has been shown to heal peripheral nerve damage like that seen in Bell’s palsy or Ramsay Hunt syndrome. The treated animals recovered facial muscle movement and symmetry, whereas untreated subjects had lasting paralysis. Given that a substantial subset of patients with facial nerve palsy suffer permanent deficits even after standard care, ExoPTEN could fill a major gap in therapy. Nurexone estimates this new indication opens up a third multi-billion dollar addressable market for the company. Notably, all three indications – spinal cord, optic nerve, and facial nerve – are being addressed with the same ExoPTEN drug, simply applied to different targets. This highlights ExoPTEN’s versatility in stimulating nerve repair across the central and peripheral nervous system.

The rapid expansion of Nurexone’s pipeline from one to three indications in just a couple of years speaks to the platform nature of its exosome therapy. As R&D Director Dr. Tali Kizhner noted, “We have shown three indications which can be addressed by the same ExoPTEN drug. A single manufacturing process serving multiple high-value indications significantly enhances the economic model.” In other words, Nurexone can invest in one production process for exosomes and one core drug product, yet potentially treat multiple diseases – a cost-efficient model for a small biotech. This multi-indication approach also de-risks the pipeline to some extent: even if one indication faces setbacks, others could still advance using the same core technology.

# Strategic Positioning and Future Outlook

Nurexone is strategically positioned as a pioneer in exosome-based regenerative medicine for neurological injuries. The company benefits from several key advantages:

* First-Mover Advantage with Novel Technology: With no approved exosome therapies on the market yet, Nurexone aims to be among the first to bring such a product into clinical trials. Its focus on acute spinal cord injury – an area with no effective drugs – could fast-track ExoPTEN’s development under orphan status and yield transformative results for patients. Positive human data in SCI would not only validate Nurexone’s platform but also set the stage for expansion into glaucoma and facial nerve indications where competition is minimal for regenerative solutions.
* Robust Intellectual Property: The ExoPTEN technology is built on research from the Technion – Israel’s Institute of Technology – and Nurexone holds a worldwide exclusive license to the underlying patents. A U.S. patent has been granted (with others granted in Japan, Russia, Israel and pending elsewhere) covering exosome-based PTEN inhibition for nerve repair. This IP position gives Nurexone freedom to operate and the ability to defend its platform across major markets as it moves towards commercialization.
* Multiple Shots on Goal: By pursuing three related indications in parallel, Nurexone diversifies its opportunities. Each target market (SCI, glaucoma, facial paralysis) is large in its own right, and success in any one could justify the platform. Yet the common therapeutic approach (ExoPTEN) means R&D efforts are synergistic. Manufacturing scale-up for one indication can serve others, and regulatory designations like Orphan Drug for SCI may aid in discussions for optic and facial nerve trials as well. The company’s recent achievements – Orphan designations granted, pre-IND meetings with FDA completed, and a growing body of peer-reviewed preclinical data – all bolster its credibility as a serious player in regenerative biotech.
* Strategic Flexibility for Partnerships or Acquisition: As a young biotech (founded 2020 in Israel), Nurexone has a relatively lean operation (fewer than 20 employees) and will require significant capital to conduct late-stage trials. Management is likely open to partnering with larger pharma or biotech companies if ExoPTEN shows clinical promise. The high value of its target markets and the novelty of its exosome platform could attract deals – for instance, big pharma might license ExoPTEN for commercialization in spinal cord injury, or even acquire Nurexone for access to its platform, as often happens once early trials succeed. Investors can take some confidence that the exit opportunities (via partnership or M&A) are tangible if Nurexone delivers strong Phase 1/2 results.

Looking ahead, the next 12–24 months will be critical for Nurexone. Key milestones include the IND approval and first-in-human trial of ExoPTEN for acute SCI (expected to commence in late 2025), as well as further preclinical progress in glaucoma and facial nerve programs. Any early human data showing safety and signs of efficacy in spinal cord injury would be a game-changer, potentially validating exosome therapy as a new modality in medicine. Given the enormous stakes – restoring movement to paralyzed patients, vision to glaucoma sufferers, or smiles to those with facial paralysis – Nurexone’s mission has a compelling humanitarian angle alongside its commercial upside.

In summary, Nurexone Biologics has leveraged cutting-edge exosome science to build a pipeline targeting three high-impact neurological conditions. By addressing the root cause of these conditions (nerve damage) rather than just symptoms, the company’s ExoTherapy platform could dramatically improve patient outcomes where current treatments fall short. The market potential is in the tens of billions of dollars across spinal cord injuries, glaucoma, and facial nerve injuries over the next decade, giving Nurexone a sizeable runway for growth. While still early-stage, the company’s strategic focus, encouraging preclinical results, and strong IP position it well in the fast-growing regenerative medicine sector. For investors knowledgeable in biotech, Nurexone represents a bold, high-reward play: if exosome-based regeneration succeeds, Nurexone could emerge as a leader in a new era of nerve repair therapeutics.",0,0,2025-05-06 02:18:08

On March 25, 2025, Mangoceuticals announced it has entered into a Master Distribution Agreement to secure the exclusive licensing and distribution rights for Diabetinol® within the United States and Canada. Diabetinol® is a clinically supported and patented plant-based nutraceutical derived from citrus peel, rich in polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) like nobiletin and tangeretin. Clinical studies have demonstrated that these compounds significantly impact metabolic processes, particularly in how the body processes and utilizes sugar and fat. Mechanistically, Diabetinol® works by improving insulin sensitivity, enhancing GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake in tissues, suppressing hepatic glucose production, and activating key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. It also reduces systemic inflammation and oxidative stress—two primary biological drivers of insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. This strategic move positions Mangoceuticals to expand its product portfolio into the $33.66 billion addressable diabetes and metabolic health market. ​

Following the announcement, Mangoceuticals’ stock experienced a significant decline, closing at $2.81 on March 25, 2025, down approximately 41.68% from the previous close. Despite this drop, the company’s 52-week range has seen highs of $16.80, indicating potential volatility. The recent dip may present a buying opportunity for investors who believe in the company’s strategic direction and its expansion into the metabolic health sector. ​

Jacob Cohen, Founder and CEO of Mangoceuticals, commented on the expansion:​

“Millions of people are left on the sidelines watching others lose weight using drugs they can’t afford. Diabetinol® is not a direct substitute for those prescription therapies, but the internal studies have concluded that it does offer complementary metabolic benefits in a safe, natural, and more affordable way. By harnessing clinically proven plant-derived ingredients, we’re providing a new option for individuals who cannot access or tolerate GLP-1 medications. Our goal is to help more people take control of their blood sugar and weight – safely, conveniently, and cost-effectively.”

Mangoceuticals plans to distribute Diabetinol® in multiple consumer-friendly formats, including capsules, ready-to-drink beverages, quick-release pouches, cookies, and gummies. Distribution channels are expected to encompass direct-to-consumer online initiatives via the company’s website and through online retailers, brick-and-mortar retail outlets, and affiliate marketing channels. ​

This expansion aligns with Mangoceuticals’ mission to improve lives through safe and accessible wellness solutions, addressing the escalating diabetes crisis and the growing demand for affordable metabolic health products.​",1,0,2025-05-02 12:58:52

biotechplays,Mangoceuticals Is Reengineering the Self-Care Blueprint with Better Personal Health and Wellness Solutions,"https://preview.redd.it/243iozku3zwe1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f117cd8e4dd743950aa79c999641f0234065923

**MIAMI, FL / ACCESS Newswire / April 24, 2025 /** For decades, the men's health space has remained largely stagnant-held back by legacy brands offering generic solutions and treatment protocols that too often felt like quick fixes rather than genuine care. The result has been an industry shaped by stigma, limited access, and minimal innovation.

That landscape is beginning to change. **Mangoceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq:MGRX)** is taking a different approach, developing products that merge clinical rigor with user-centric design-responding to how people actually live today. With offerings that now span men's ED, hormonal balance, hair restoration, and weight loss-alongside a recently launched women's wellness platform, PeachesRx-the company is reshaping expectations across multiple health categories.

**Treatment Reimagined for Today's World**

Among the company's most notable developments is Mango, a flagship product that addresses erectile dysfunction (ED) in a way that feels more modern, discreet, and accessible. While ED remains a common issue-impacting over 70% of men at some point-treatment solutions have long felt dated, often defined by clinical detachment and social stigma.

Mango offers a sublingual, fast-dissolving tablet that delivers active compounds without the pharmacy line or blue-pill branding. The rapid-onset format avoids liver metabolism for quicker effect and a smoother user experience.

Available in two primary formulations-Sildenafil Mango and Tadalafil Mango -each product combines a proven PDE5 inhibitor with L-arginine for enhanced blood flow and oxytocin for emotional connection. This combination represents a deliberate move away from single-ingredient solutions, toward more comprehensive sexual wellness.

**Addressing Hormonal Health Through Oral TRT**

The focus on real-world practicality continues with Mangoceuticals' approach to testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). Low testosterone is often under-diagnosed or left untreated, in part because existing treatments-such as injections or topical gels-can be inconvenient, uncomfortable, or difficult to manage.

Prime by MangoRx introduces a more approachable alternative. At its core is Kyzatrex™, an FDA-approved oral testosterone capsule. Designed to deliver a consistent, daily dose without the hormonal spikes associated with other delivery methods, it offers a smoother, more manageable path to hormone balance.

Through the company's integrated telehealth platform, patients can complete lab work, consultations, and prescription fulfillment entirely from home. This ease of access helps remove longstanding barriers to care-bringing more people into the fold who may have previously felt excluded.

**Hair Loss Solutions with a Functional Edge**

As part of its broader expansion, Mangoceuticals has also entered the hair restoration market-a segment traditionally dominated by topical foams, shampoos, and overstated promises.

Grow by MangoRx is structured differently. Delivered as a mint-flavored, pharmaceutical-grade chewable, it contains a synergistic blend of minoxidil (to encourage growth), finasteride (to reduce DHT), biotin (for structure), and vitamin D3 (to support follicle health). This comprehensive stack addresses both the cause and symptoms of hair loss in a convenient daily format.

Rather than introducing another product that treats hair health as a cosmetic issue, Grow approaches it as a clinical concern with psychological and emotional dimensions. That distinction may prove significant, as the global hair restoration market surpassed $6 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 16% through 2030.

**Metabolic Health Without the Needle**

Expanding beyond core categories, Mangoceuticals has also stepped into one of the fastest-growing areas in wellness: weight management. Rather than replicating existing solutions, the company is working to reduce access barriers with two complementary approaches.

The first is Slim by MangoRx, a dissolvable sublingual tablet that delivers Semaglutide-the same GLP-1 receptor agonist found in drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. Combined with Vitamin B6, Slim offers a non-injectable, frictionless option for those looking to manage appetite and improve metabolic outcomes.

Alongside Slim, Mangoceuticals has secured exclusive rights in the U.S. and Canada to Diabetinol®, a citrus-derived nutraceutical containing nobiletin and tangeretin. These naturally occurring compounds are being explored for their potential to improve insulin sensitivity, lower glucose production, and reduce inflammation-making them a promising adjunct or alternative for those priced out of prescription GLP-1s.

**An Integrated Ecosystem, Not Just a Product Line**

Viewed together, these offerings suggest Mangoceuticals is building more than a portfolio-it's constructing a wellness infrastructure. The company's blend of telehealth, clinically relevant formulations, and lifestyle-compatible delivery formats reflects a broader ambition: to modernize personal health by design, not default.

At a time when many players in the wellness space lean heavily on branding or trend alignment, Mangoceuticals is emphasizing something else entirely: evidence-backed design, category-specific innovation, and patient-centric service.

Its long-term trajectory remains to be seen, but the early signals suggest that the company is operating from a different playbook-one focused not on rebranding old solutions, but on redefining what effective care can look like in the modern era.",1,0,2025-04-25 13:17:56

biotechplays,"Harmony Biosciences (HRMY) 2x Upside, Good Margin of Safety, Near Term Catalyst","**Thesis Summary**

Harmony Biosciences is a profitable, underappreciated CNS biotech with a cash‑flowing core asset (WAKIX) and a deep late‑stage pipeline. Even under conservative assumptions, WAKIX in narcolepsy alone covers nearly the entire enterprise value (EV), leaving the pipeline—especially ZYN002 in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS)—as free upside (topline Q3 2025). I believe a massive overreaction to an RTF from the FDA and some overhang from a previous shortseller report has made this opportunity available.

**1. WAKIX in Narcolepsy: Core Value Anchor With Extremely Conservative Assumptions**

• Revenues: $850 M in 2025; $1 B in 2026 (company guidance)

• FCF Margin: 30%

• Erosion: 40% share loss from 2027–2029 due to anticipated TAK‑861 entry

• Generic Cliff: full competition begins Jan 1, 2030 (ANDA settlement)

• Milestones: $150 M deducted

• Terminal Value: none assumed beyond 2029

• Resulting NPV: $881 M (\~62% of current \~$1.4 B EV)

**2. Pipeline Optionality (Effectively Free)**

**ZYN002 in FXS**

• RECONNECT Phase 3 readout Q3 2025

• US target \~70 K fully methylated patients

• Peak US sales: \~30% penetration × $100 K = $2.1 B

I’m a physician, and anecdotally many of my colleagues would have no problem prescribing this and explaining the CBD connotations to families.

• Risk‑adjusted at 50% PoS → NPV $700–900 M

This PoS could have been higher, but unfortunately the trial is a little bit underpowered relative to the previous >90% methylation subgroup, making the margin on a significant p value razor thin.

• Global upside could double to $1.4–1.8 B

The company has hired a CCO with global experience, signalling a willingness to market this aggressively WW

**Other Assets**

• WAKIX label expansions (PWS, DM1, IH): combined PoS‑adjusted NPV $100–300 M

• EPX‑100 in Dravet: PoS‑adjusted NPV $50–100 M

I believe they overpaid for their Dravet asset, but this is all free upside.

**3. Controversies & Risk Mitigation**

• **IH RTF:** should have been expected by the market, there was no way the FDA was going to approve their sNDA with the data they had in hand, this was a moonshot. The \~30% plunge is insane given everything else they have going on, and provides us with a nice opportunity.

• **Short‑seller report (2023):** allegations rebutted by patent defense, rising prescriptions, strong FCF margins.

• **Insider selling:** CFO and CCO sales can be explained by normal activity (and the CCO being replaced)

**4. Financials & Capital**

• 2024 Revenue: $714.7 M

• 2024 Free Cash Flow: $\~150M (\~20% margin, though with major acquisitions to build a pipeline into 2029)

• Cash Balance: \~$500 M; 340M debt; buyback capacity (150M authorized - I think the company understands it is undervalued, but has better uses for its cash in its planned developmental programs)",3,2,2025-04-21 20:16:12

biotechplays,Vaxart’s Underdog Story Is Just Getting Started – The Next Chapter Is About to Explode,"Let’s take a step back and look at the story Vaxart (VXRT) is writing.

This is not just another penny biotech. Vaxart is a disruptor. While the giants pushed traditional vaccine delivery methods, Vaxart quietly developed a revolutionary oral tablet vaccine platform — needle-free, shelf-stable, easy to distribute globally. This tech has the potential to reshape how vaccines are delivered across the world.

Yes, VXRT took a beating during the biotech downturn. But what many traders miss is that Vaxart survived. They kept innovating while others folded. Their Norovirus program is advancing. Their COVID and flu platforms are still in play. The IP is strong, the vision is intact, and the cash burn is under control compared to other biotechs.

We’re looking at a company that was once a $10+ stock with insane volume, now trading under a buck — but the fundamentals are better now than they were during the hype. The risk/reward down here is ridiculous.

What happens when one catalyst hits? Or when biotech sentiment turns? Or when someone bigger sees the value of an oral vaccine platform and wants in?

This is accumulation territory. Quiet now, but it won’t stay that way for long.

biotechplays,DD: Cereno Scientific (CRNOF) – A Biotech Sleeper With Big Potential,"**Disclosure**: *I hold shares. This is not financial advice – just a best effort to summarize the current state of Cereno Scientific as objectively and accessibly as possible.*

This is a follow-up to the DD posted about 12 months ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/s/YY6BZofeHt). Much has happened since then.

You’ve probably never heard of Cereno Scientific (https://cerenoscientific.com/). But if you’re into asymmetric biotech plays with massive upside and near-term catalysts — this is one to watch.

Cereno is a Swedish biotech company developing disease-modifying therapies for severe cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases — including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). These are progressive, often deadly conditions with limited treatment options today.

But Cereno isn’t targeting just symptom relief. Their approach is epigenetic modulation — in simple terms: turning disease-driving genes off and protective genes on. Think of it as reprogramming cells without altering the DNA itself.

**This is next-gen medicine — and Cereno already has real-world data to back it up.**

Where Are We Today?
- CS1 (lead drug) has completed a Phase IIa trial in PAH with remarkable results. 
- CS014 (second candidate) just finished Phase I and moves toward IPF. 
- CS585 is in preclinical development with anti-thrombotic potential.

Let’s be clear: in their Phase IIa, patients already on triple therapy (standard of care) improved so significantly on CS1 that one investigator reportedly contacted the company directly, shocked by the changes. One patient nearly normalized — an extremely rare event in PAH, which is a progressive disease with a life expectancy–upon diagnosis–of about 7 years.

What happened next? Doctors literally *refused to stop treatment* after the trial ended. They pushed Cereno to apply for Compassionate Use — and the FDA approved it. Several patients from the Phase IIa trial are now receiving CS1 long-term before it’s even approved.

That doesn’t happen every day.

**Recent Milestones and Upcoming Catalysts**
- Type-C FDA meeting – April 21 (this Monday): will shape the design for the Phase IIb pivotal trial.
- Readout from the Compassionate Use program (CU) – expected May–June.
- Topline data from CS014 Phase I – expected in June 2025.
- IND submission for CS1 Phase IIb – likely late Q2 or early Q3.
- Phase IIb study launch – H1 2026 is realistic.
- Several key conferences for partnership activity linked up, including Bio International (June 3–6).

**Cereno Now Trades on the US OTC Market**

As of this morning (18 April 2025), Cereno has quietly appeared on platforms like WSJ, Barron’s, TradingView, and OTCMarkets under the ticker CRNOF (see: https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CRNOF; the profile will likely get populated over the coming days). This enables American investors to buy the stock. Something several investors have been calling for during the last year or so.

Here’s the interesting part:

This OTC listing has not yet been formally communicated by the company.
But we suspect it will be publicly announced in the coming days.

**But Why Haven’t I Heard About This Yet?**

Great question. About a year ago, someone posted a detailed DD here (https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1cb8oxm/dd_cereno_has_presented_results_that_look_better/) explaining the fundamentals. It covered the leadership team (ex-AstraZeneca, ex-Abbott), the science, the platform, and the massive opportunity behind CS1 and CS014.

**Since then?**
- The Phase IIa results were strong and impressive, with clear signs of disease modifying abilities.
- FDA approved Compassionate Use.
- The pipeline has progressed.
- Talks with Big Pharma are ongoing (confirmed by the CEO).
- OTC entry quietly happened.

The company has been methodical — but clearly positioning for something bigger.

**Valuation Snapshot**
- Current market cap: ~$195M USD
- YTD return: +76.39% past 12 months, of which +49.85% the last 3 months
- Edison Group valuation: 14.2 SEK/share (~$1.3 USD) - conservative valuation to say the least 

Despite this recent rally, Cereno remains **significantly undervalued**. The stock has barely tapped into its potential, particularly in light of clinical progress, pipeline maturity, and regulatory milestones approaching in Q2 and Q3 2025.

For comparison, Sotatercept (Winrevair) — the only newly approved drug in PAH — was acquired by Merck for $11.5B USD in 2021, based on mid-stage data. Today, Cereno trades at less than 2% of that valuation, despite reporting data that surprised even the principal investigators and enabled FDA-approved Compassionate Use — a rare outcome for a Phase 2a program.

Notably, Cereno is on track to be considered best-in-class in terms of *safety and tolerability*, as reaffirmed in the recent Biostock interview with CEO Sten Sörensen and CMO Rahul Agrawal (https://youtu.be/IqLm5ZO2LYw?si=gOphhQo8Ojpllisb). This edge is expected to play a pivotal role in future partnering or licensing discussions.

That’s without factoring in:
- CS014 in IPF (massive unmet need)
- The value of CS585
- Potential expansion into other indications like thrombosis and fibrosis
- The value of long-term Compassionate Use data, which few competitors can match

**Closing Thoughts**

Cereno is shaping up to be a classic under-the-radar biotech play:
- Real clinical data — not just “promising preclinical stuff”
- A unique mechanism of action with epigenetic modulation
- Strong leadership and board, including global COPDs in cardiology
- FDA traction, clear regulatory path, and global patent protection
- Now accessible to US retail via OTC (CRNOF)

It’s early — but the pieces are coming together.

biotechplays,VXRT: Pill-based COVID vaccine buried by the system — May catalyst could revive it,"Vaxart ($VXRT) created a pill-form COVID vaccine — no needles, no cold storage, easier global distribution, and potential mucosal immunity. But despite early promise, the government halted their trial via the HHS, while injections dominated the market.

Now they have a formal review scheduled in May to determine next steps. With a reverse split on the table, the float would shrink dramatically. If the review clears them to resume, this could re-ignite interest fast — especially with such disruptive tech.

Nobody’s watching. No one’s talking. But the idea of a shelf-stable, needle-free vaccine is still powerful — especially if this review goes their way. Could be a sleeper play. Worth keeping an eye on.

biotechplays,$MUEL - Big benefactor from reshoring pharmaceutical manufacturing to the US,"**Company overview**: Paul Mueller Company, headquartered in Springfield Missouri, is a domestic manufacturer of high-quality stainless-steel tanks and related industrial processing equipment for end markets that include: pharmaceutical ingredient production (largest sector by far), dairy farming, beer/alcohol production, and chemical/energy production.

**Current play/growth driver – Reshoring of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing**:

* The Trump administration is pushing to reshore pharmaceutical manufacturing to the United States through proposed tariffs on imported drugs, aiming to incentivize companies to relocate production from countries like China and India back to the US. This strategy seeks to reduce reliance on foreign supply chains, particularly for active pharmaceutical ingredients, by making domestic production more financially viable. By bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., domestic integrators like Paul Mueller CO will benefit from increased investment and job creation. Companies like $LLY, $JNJ and $NVS have already announced multi billion dollar commitments to reshore pharmaceutical manufacturing to the US and will need to contract companies like Paul Mueller to design, build and install necessary drug manufacturing equipment.

* Several states like Missouri and Iowa, where $MUEL heavily operates in, are actively promoting the reshoring of pharmaceutical manufacturing, particularly active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), with the states awarding muti-million dollar grants and contracts to support these efforts. For example, looking at Missouri specifically, the state in association with its API Innovation Center at the University of Missouri–St. Louis announced this past February that they are aiming to reshore manufacturing for at least 25 essential medications and have announced several multi million-dollar contracts. Furthermore, several companies like Kindeva, MilliporeSigma and Boehringer Ingelheim have publicly announced their intentions to reshore drug manufacturing to the Missouri area with investments ranging from 76-100+ million.

* Some of these investments are already having an impact on Paul Muellers financials as the company has already announced accepting purchase orders totaling 120m from the pharmaceutical market in March of this year (orders that are to be completed from now until late 2026).

* The company has noticed the ongoing macroeconomic tends and is strategically growing; has announced multiple expansions to its Components Products facilities that are focused on modular construction of large pharmaceutical and processing equipment and product development.

**Key Financial metrics (FY 2024) - indicate the company has very attractive valuation metrics**:

* Revenue: $248,585,000 (8.5% growth from 2023, poised for accelerating growth given increasing reshoring efforts/macroeconomic trends)
* Net Income: $29,672,000 (41% growth from adjusted 2023)
* Market Cap: ~$234,209,250 (At $250 stock price)
* P/E Ratio: ~8.3 (Undervalued compared to industry norms of 15-25)
* EV/EBITDA: ~5.1 (Undervalued compared to industry norms of 8-12)
* Cash and Cash Equivalents: $21,169,000 (Exceeds total debt)
* Total Debt: ~$8,146,000 (Long-term + current liabilities)

**Broader impact of Tariffs**: The current administration's tariff policies could further benefit Paul Mueller even beyond its pharmaceutical manufacturing segment, particularly its farming and chemical/energy segment could also serve to significantly improve. Tariffs will make imported equipment costlier, favoring domestic manufacturers. For instance, large dairy farming companies historically benefited from cheaper imported equipment, but tariffs could shift focus back to domestic suppliers like Paul Mueller. While the tariff impacts will undoubtedly be nuanced, as tariffs could also increase costs for Paul Mueller as they heavily utilize steel as a raw good, though its domestic manufacturing base suggests net benefits.

**Stock Buyback program**: On March 31, 2025, the company announced a tender offer to repurchase up to $15 million worth of shares at $250 per share, a 25% premium over the then-current trading price of $199. This move, effective until May 7, 2025, reflects management's confidence in the future direction of the company. Furthermore, the company has done multiple stock buy backs historically to return excess cash to shareholders.

**Conclusion**: Key financials and the macroeconomic outlook indicate a significant gap between the business's intrinsic value and its current share price, even when considering that the stock price is up >200% in the past year. Reshoring of pharmaceutical manufacturing will drive continued growth. Paul Mueller Co ( $MUEL) to me seems like a great pharma adjacent long-term hold.",1,0,2025-04-18 13:50:09

* General and administrative expenses were US$3.14 million in 2024, compared to US$2.12 million in 2023. For Q4-2024, expenses were US$0.85 million, compared to US$0.40 million in the previous year, as the Company streamlined operations while continuing to support strategic growth.
* Financial income/expenses, net, were US$0.03 million of expense in 2024, compared to US$0.02 million of income in 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2024, financial expenses were US$0.06 million, compared to US$0.02 million in the previous year. The change was primarily due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and interest expenses.
* Net loss for 2024 was US$5.04 million, compared to US$3.64 million in 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2024, net loss was US$1.55 million, compared to US$0.74 million in the previous year. The change is primarily reflecting increased R&D spending and corporate development activities.
* Cash position: As of December 31, 2024, the Company had total cash and equivalents of US$0.70 million, compared to US$0.54 million as of December 31, 2023. The change is primarily attributed to capital raised through warrant exercises and private placements, offset by operational expenditures.
* The Company remains in the research and development stage and has not yet commercialized any products or generated significant revenue.

*Diabetinol\*\***^(®)* *is a clinically supported and patented plant-based nutraceutical* product targeting the pre-diabetic and weight loss marketplace

DALLAS, TX, March 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mangoceuticals, Inc. ( MGRX) (""Mangoceuticals"" or the ""Company""), a company focused on developing, marketing, and selling a variety of health and wellness products via a secure telemedicine platform under the brands MangoRx and PeachesRx, today announced that it has entered into a Master Distribution Agreement (the “Agreement”) to secure the exclusive licensing and distribution rights for Diabetinol^(®) within the United States and Canada.

Diabetinol^(®) is a plant-based nutraceutical clinically supported and patented extract of citrus peel rich in polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs), including nobiletin and tangeretin. Based on clinical studies performed, these compounds have demonstrated significant metabolic effects, particularly in how the body processes and utilizes sugar and fat. Mechanistically, Diabetinol^(®) works by improving insulin sensitivity, enhancing GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake in tissues, suppressing hepatic glucose production, and activating key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. It also reduces systemic inflammation and oxidative stress—two of the primary biological drivers of insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.

Under the agreement, Mangoceuticals will hold the exclusive rights to market and sell Diabetinol^(®) across the United States and Canada, expanding its product portfolio into the $33.66 billion addressable diabetes and metabolic health market.

“Millions of people are left on the sidelines watching others lose weight using drugs they can’t afford,” said Jacob Cohen, Founder and CEO of Mangoceuticals, Inc., who continued, “Diabetinol^(®) is not a direct substitute for those prescription therapies, but the internal studies have concluded that it does offer complementary metabolic benefits in a safe, natural, and more affordable way. By harnessing clinically proven plant-derived ingredients, we’re providing a new option for individuals who cannot access or tolerate GLP-1 medications. Our goal is to help more people take control of their blood sugar and weight – safely, conveniently, and cost-effectively.”

Mangoceuticals’ expansion into metabolic health is timely given the escalating diabetes crisis and the enormous total addressable market for such solutions. In the U.S. alone, over 30 million Americans suffer from type 2 diabetes, and approximately 97.6 million American adults—more than one in three—have prediabetes. Globally, an estimated 537 million adults are currently living with diabetes, and that number is expected to rise to 783 million by 2045. If current trends continue, projections suggest it could exceed 1.3 billion by 2050.

The healthcare burden associated with this is immense. U.S. diabetes-related healthcare costs are already over $400 billion per year. Meanwhile, global spending on weight loss and blood sugar–lowering medications reached $24 billion in 2023 and is projected to surpass $131 billion by 2028. Currently, many people are prescribed metformin yet discontinue second-line therapies due to cost or tolerability. With an estimated 50% of Americans actively trying to lose weight at any given time, the demand for safer, more affordable metabolic health solutions is surging.

We believe that Diabetinol^(®) is well-positioned to fill that gap. As a naturally derived, clinically supported nutraceutical, it offers a compelling option for consumers who either can’t tolerate or access GLP-1 drugs, or who are seeking to support their health with a non-pharmaceutical approach.

Mangoceuticals intends to distribute Diabetinol^(®) in multiple consumer-friendly formats including capsules, a ready-to-drink beverage, quick-release pouches, cookies, and gummies. Each product will be carefully dosed to deliver consistent clinical levels of Diabetinol’s active ingredients. Distribution is expected to include direct-to-consumer online initiatives via our own website and through online retailers, brick and mortar retail outlets, and affiliate marketing channels.

Najla Guthrie, Founder of KGK Synergize and a recognized leader in nutraceutical clinical research, expressed strong support for Diabetinol’s role in addressing metabolic dysfunction, “I believe that Diabetinol^(®) has the potential to revolutionize how we think about supporting metabolic health. Its unique blend of natural citrus-derived compounds has been shown to deliver meaningful improvements in glycemic control, lipid profiles, and blood pressure—offering a safe and clinically validated adjunct to conventional care for those with prediabetes or diabetes,” said Guthrie. She further noted that Diabetinol’s formulation, centered around compounds like nobiletin and tangeretin, has been shown in rigorous clinical trials to improve glucose tolerance and lipid levels without adverse impacts on liver, kidney, or other organ functions and believes that these findings support Diabetinol as a safe, science-backed option to help manage blood sugar and reduce risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease.

Mr. Cohen further added, “Obtaining the exclusive rights to Diabetinol is a major milestone for Mangoceuticals. We are proud to introduce an innovative, science-backed nutraceutical that aligns with our mission of improving lives through safe and accessible wellness solutions. Diabetinol’s arrival could not be more timely, as the world faces a metabolic health epidemic and we have seen that patients are seeking alternatives that are both effective and affordable. We believe Diabetinol^(®) can become an invaluable option for individuals looking to take charge of their metabolic health, and we’re excited to lead that charge.”

In recent years, there has been growing public awareness around the need for cleaner, more natural approaches to health and wellness. Leaders in the national health conversation, including newly appointed United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have emphasized the importance of reducing reliance on synthetic pharmaceuticals in favor of preventive, plant-based solutions, where appropriate. We believe that Diabetinol^(®) reflects this shift—offering a science-backed, naturally derived option for those seeking to support their metabolic health with fewer chemicals and greater transparency.

**About Diabetinol\*\*\*\*****^(®)** **Clinical Studies**

In a 3-month pilot study involving participants with impaired glucose metabolism, Diabetinol^(®) was shown to reduce peak postprandial blood glucose by approximately 50 mg/dL following a glucose challenge test. This reduction is considered clinically meaningful, as it eases the burden on pancreatic beta cells and lowers the risk of long-term damage caused by repeated glucose spikes. Diabetinol^(®) helped participants stabilize blood sugar responses after meals, which is essential for preserving insulin function and preventing complications associated with hyperglycemia.

In a 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes who were already on conventional medications, Diabetinol^(®) was shown to significantly improve a range of health markers. Among those taking Diabetinol^(®), 14.3% reached Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) targets (compared to 0% of the placebo group), 33.3% reached LDL cholesterol goals (vs. 15.4% placebo), 20% reached total cholesterol goals (vs. 12.5% placebo), and 83.3% reached systolic blood pressure goals (vs. 60% placebo). Participants also experienced improved glucose tolerance over time, with a slower rise in fasting glucose levels and improved Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) profiles—especially in individuals aged 40 to 60.

biotechplays,Cassava Sciences (ticker: $SAVA) – 12-Month Outlook & Strategic Considerations,"Cassava Sciences (NASDAQ: SAVA) is a clinical-stage biotech company that has recently experienced a steep decline following the failure of its Alzheimer’s drug candidate, simufilam, in late-stage clinical trials. After previously trading above $100 during the biotech bull cycle in 2021, the stock has plunged over 95% from its highs and is currently trading near $1.16 as of April 2025.

Despite its collapse, the company still holds meaningful cash reserves and has signaled a shift in R&D focus. The following is a strategic overview of potential price levels, catalyst events, and risk-reward factors to consider over the next 12 months.

# 🔹 Potential Price Levels

|Zone|Range (USD)|Rationale|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Support|\~$1.00–$2.00|This zone reflects the company’s cash-per-share valuation; RSI is oversold.|
|Resistance 1|\~$4.00|Last major support before the November 2024 collapse; potential retracement.|
|Resistance 2|\~$8.00–$10.00|Psychological zone, achievable in the event of a major catalyst or M&A.|

* Analyst price targets are now clustered around $2.00, in line with the company’s cash value.
* A return to $10+ would require exceptionally positive news, such as a strategic partnership or successful preclinical results with a clear regulatory path.

# 🔹 Key Potential Catalysts (2025)

1. Preclinical data for epilepsy (TSC-related): Cassava has announced that it will explore simufilam’s application in tuberous sclerosis complex–related epilepsy in preclinical studies. Positive early results from this program could help reestablish scientific credibility and investor interest.
2. Strategic partnerships or M&A activity: With \~$128.6M in cash at the end of 2024 and low burn rate, Cassava remains a potential target for acquisition or partnership, especially if its platform shows promise in new therapeutic areas. Notably, executive bonuses were recently restructured to only pay out in the event of FDA approval or a merger — signaling that management is open to strategic options.
3. Regulatory progress: Any FDA acceptance of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application in a new indication (e.g., epilepsy) could boost the stock. Fast-track or orphan drug designations would also be bullish signals.
4. Legal & reputational resolution: The company recently reached a court-approved $40M civil settlement regarding securities litigation. If remaining legal uncertainties (such as investigations into affiliated researchers) are resolved without additional liability, it could remove an overhang from the stock.
5. Capital allocation clarity: With its current market cap (\~$58M) trading well below its cash reserves, how the company allocates capital in 2025 will be pivotal. Initiatives such as share buybacks, licensing deals, or reallocation to credible programs could drive valuation re-rating.

# 🔹 Risk-Reward Outlook

Risks:

* Failure to deliver any meaningful preclinical progress in its new epilepsy program.
* Continued investor distrust stemming from simufilam's failure and past controversies.
* Possibility of the company becoming a “zombie biotech” — cash-rich, but with no viable clinical programs or catalysts.

Upside:

* Extremely low valuation provides an asymmetric setup if even modest progress is achieved.
* Strong balance sheet (\~$2.00/share in cash) provides cushion and optionality.
* Potential for outsized moves typical of biotech short-squeeze candidates, especially if new momentum or sentiment shift emerges.

# 🔹 Summary

Cassava Sciences is in a high-risk, high-volatility phase. While its core Alzheimer’s program has failed, it is not bankrupt, and the company has enough capital to pivot. For speculative investors, the focus should now be on execution in new directions, particularly the epilepsy preclinical program and any external partnerships.

Should the company manage to produce promising early-stage data or attract a strategic partner, the upside potential is significant, even if a return to former all-time highs remains highly unlikely without transformative news.

In the meantime, investors should monitor:

* Quarterly updates and cash burn,
* Preclinical milestones and IND filings,
* Insider buying or institutional positioning,
* Legal/judicial resolution developments.

biotech,Donald’s actions - a 1-2 punch to biotech?!?,"It seems that biotech can’t catch any kind of break recently!

First, Donald and his appointees go to work dismantling NIH and holding biomedical research grants as leverage against universities. 

Then, today, Donald announces a ruthless effort to slash drug prices in US based on ‘favored nation status’. 

The first action will stunt innovation and wellspring of innovative therapies or therapeutic insights from academia. Also, it will stunt the future worker population in biotech. Nearly every quality PhD, Master’s or even Medical leader in biotech has relied on NIH related funding as part of their training prior to joining the biotech industry.

On slashing drug costs - while it’s a long overdue effort, Donald’s proposal could completely gut pharma & biotech profits, and leave many biotechs with no commercial viability in their lead assets. 
An unspoken truth with biotech in US is that companies generate the vast majority of their profits from sales in US, because of the largely laissez faire system of drug pricing in US. 
Because nearly every other developed nation has national drug pricing negotiation, it’s not as though pharma/biotech companies could just raise prices outside the US to make up for any cuts in US pricing.

Add to all this a general anti-science bias that shuns vaccines (and actively promotes anti-vax ideology) and MAHA (make America healthy again) mantra and idea of shunning medications in general, makes for a challenging environment to develop and sell therapies in US. 

What do others think? Are dire times ahead as a result of current admin actions?

biotech,R&D Exit Opportunities,"I’m currently a research scientist in pharma, based in the UK. I’m on the chemistry side of things, following a PhD in Chemistry.

I’ve enjoyed my job so far however there’s always a couple of concerns:
- Salary in UK for science is, quite frankly, shit for the experience/education you need.
- Lack of established pharma R&D which leads to huge competition for very few jobs.
- The constant anxiety about reorganisations/layoffs, which in turn makes everything more competitive
- Benchwork is frankly becoming boring and I wish I had more flexibility in terms of hybrid/WFH.

R&D is an expensive department and tariffs, AI, outsourcing are all threats, as is big pharma simply buying assets instead of making them in-house. This has led me to question the security of my career in R&D, and I’m wondering whether it’s something I can survive in for the long-term.

So, I’ve gone through this sub and other subs to try and find career paths R&D scientists take to leave R&D. I love science and research but I want to use my technical knowledge/interest outside of R&D.

Some things I’ve seen are:
- Life science consultancy
- Regulatory affairs
- Medical affairs
- Medical science liaisons
- Project management
- Patent attorneys (huge shift!)

I wanted to get the opinions of those of you in those sub who left R&D, about what career path you took, and:
- What made you leave
- What did you move into
- Have you enjoyed the shift

From the list, reg/medical affairs seems interesting to me from a career/science balance POV, whilst patents seems very stable and lucrative.

biotech,Viridos (formerly Synthetic Genomics) layoffs,"Not a big name biotech, but if you’re in San Diego you’re probably familiar with this company. They were under public scrutiny a few years ago after they laid off 100+ people in 2022 after they lost funding from Exxon and gave employees no severance or exit package (shame!!)

It seems like they just had another layoff/RIF recently after the long time CEO quietly left the company late last year. I was just wondering if anyone knows if they’re still R&D operational now, or turn into a zombie company now waiting to sell assets/IP?

biotech,Is the cell and gene therapy bubble bursting and where to go from here?,"I've been seeing Vor Bio's CSO sharing posts from his employees seeking new jobs, and it's gotten me thinking about where cell and gene therapy is headed. Vor Bio's approach—knocking out CD33 in hematopoietic stem cells, transplanting them into AML patients, then targeting CD33 on leukemic cells—seemed scientifically sound. Unlike more ambitious claims (like inserting any genetic sequence anywhere), this was straightforward. Yet, despite the solid premise, Vor shut down after negative clinical data.

Vor isn’t alone; numerous companies have folded after entering clinical trials or even earlier. Failures related to scaling or manufacturing are understandable since those issues typically surface only at industrial scale. However, when failure stems from the fundamental scientific hypothesis—the inability to reproduce the founders’ high-profile Nature paper, for example, it highlights a deeper, systemic issue.

I've personally experienced situations where companies couldn’t reproduce even basic positive results from preclinical models, despite claims made during funding rounds. Many peers have shared similar stories. This makes me wonder: how do such flawed ideas make it past rigorous - I assume- VC evaluations? Could better scientific oversight from VCs prevent millions from being wasted?  

Another puzzling aspect is the endgame for these founders. They must realize their products might never reach the market. Then it struck me: it might simply be a career strategy. Jumping from an academic or postdoc salary ($70–150K/year) to an executive role ($300–400K/year) for several years can substantially boost one's career and financial status. Post-company, many transition into investment banking or research equity roles, possibly even launching another startup. After all, (this is how science work), and no one blames you if the science doesn't pan out. Sure, they probably won't become the next Bob Duggan, but hey - it's still a nice upgrade from being just another unknown academic.",148,57,2025-05-12 01:24:58

biotech,Moving from Small Biotech to Big Pharma,"Hi all, title says most of it already. I'm in my early 50ies and have worked at two small (\~20-50 employees) startups. I've been at the VP/Head of Biology level for the past couple of years (across both companies) and I have broad expertise from TID/VAL to Preclinical--> PhI program leadership.

  
I'm currently trying to figure out if there's a way to get from this background into a bigger pharma job. I've applied to several (Senior) Director positions that fit my profile and where I hit virtually all the requirements. So far, I've not heard back from any of them, even when I had a connection make sure the hiring manager sees my application. Witch small biotechs I have maybe about a 10-20% response rate.

Have others here successfully made the jump from small biotech to pharma? If so, where there some special circumstances or did you just apply?",57,33,2025-05-11 20:11:29

After working on the software side of the industry, I kept seeing how much risk goes into finding and vetting the right manufacturing or research partner. I know it’s nuanced and is never going to be a perfectly smooth process, but I do think that finding a service partner could be a lot easier if more experiences were shared openly. The goal of this site is to help teams make better decisions with less guesswork. I’m coming at this from a software developer’s perspective, so any thoughts on what info should be shown would really help me make this site more useful. Here is the rough draft: [www.biotechservicefinder.com](http://www.biotechservicefinder.com)

I’m still working on building out the data, and wondering what would be most useful for you all to see when choosing a partner. I'm considering adding in FDA warning letters or other regulatory specifics that would help with due diligence.

On a personal note - I have family in academia, so if I’m not someone doing research and development, I want to build tools that help speed up the process.

biotech,Career Advice: Switching back to Biotech from IT,"Hello!
I graduated in biotechnology engineering. 
During the course, I realized wet lab works—especially microbiology—just wasn’t for me. On the other hand, I really liked the dry lab and computational (especially SAS) parts. After graduation, I ended up switching to IT because there weren’t many opportunities in biotech and another option available to me was to go for higher studies. But I didn't want to go for higher studies as I had not figured out my interests clearly. 

The IT job was tough in the beginning, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly. It’s been about two years now, but lately I’ve been feeling kind of bored with it. I keep thinking about how I moved away from biotech and regret doing it and part of me really wants to go back to  Biotech - just not the lab work. 

Currenty,  I’m interested in switching back into something more aligned with biotech, ideally something that combines it with my current IT experience as i don't want this experience go into waste, but I’m not exactly sure how to go about it—and I don’t want those two years in IT to feel like a waste. So yeah, I’m just a bit lost and confused at the moment. 

I’d really appreciate any advice or guidance on how to navigate this or what options I should explore.

Thanks.

biotech,"How to improve my resume, if I don't have linear career trajectories","I created another post asking about some suggestions on how to overcome some weird career progression in the past, but I didn't include my resume. So let me try again. 

For context, in theory, I should have about 8 years post-PhD experiences: 2 years of academic postdoc, it wasn't very successful, so I decided to leave and moved into some IT companies (non-biotech) for 2.5 years (learned some new skills and also leadership experiences). Then, I missed biotech, but it was Covid. Couldn't get a better job, I decided to do another academic postdoc for 2.5 years. Last year, I got a job in a pharma company, but when I got the offer, they did not consider my experiences (because of academic positions and/or outside of the US industrial experiences), so they offered a position below what I was applying for. I was desperate so I took the offer anyway, but It turns out a total chaos.

If you were me, how would you structure your resume? Can you point anything that that can still be improved?  I sent out many applications, but either immediately rejected or didn't hear back at all. I feel like something wrong with my resume, or it is just not competitive enough. Also, I am tryng to secure some positions along the line of research and discovery (synthetic biology, high throughput screening, automation). Thanks for any feedback and suggestions.

biotech,MSc dissertation defense,"I'm about to defend my dissertation but all ofy plans were terribly ruined.
My first project was to evaluate thru qPCR and rnaseq the osteoinductive and osteoconductive potencial of a hydrogel based on natural polysaccharide in mesenchymal stem cells.
But, not content with this project, I've talked to my advisor and we agreed in incorporate a flavonoid in the hydrogel matrix, and evaluate not only the osteogenic potencial on MSC but also the immunomodulatory effect on periotneal macrophages.
Ends up, my laboratory had all the technical problems you all can imagine and we had to stop all experiments for 1 whole year.
Now, the only result I got are: the Raman spectra of the hydrogel pure and the hydrogel with the flavonoid. Biocompatibility tests of the pure hydrogel (MTT, hemolysis, nitric oxide synthesis - Griess reaction) - and, while I had nothing to do due to the lab lock, I've done some pharmacology network using the intersection of genes related to my flavonoid and genes related to osteogenesis, made some PPI and clustering, and PPI networks. Also, molecular docking of the flavonoid on important proteins for osteogenesis and immunomodulation, and ADMET to evaluate the possible behaviour of the flavonoid on the hydrogel matrix.
I know it lacks a lot of other testing, but my time is up, and that's all I got.
I've worked on my discussion in the following way: compared the Raman spectra of the pure hydrogel, the pure flavonoid and the hydrogel+flavonoid (it seems like the funtionalization went well), discussed about the biocompatibility of the pure hydrogel (from the in vitro testing), discussed a lot about the PPI network derived from the pharmacology network, emphasizing the genes with higher centrality. I've talked about each one, with comparisons and examples. The docking also went well, I've compared the energy with the agonists of each protein and they were all similar, and then, the admet supports a result that the flavonoid is good for topic administration and controlled liberation due to its pharmacokinetics properties.
I've concluded that the flavonoid in question, incorporated with the pure hydrogel, is possibly a good product for bone healing, and it needs some in vitro and in vivo testing to confirm.

I'm applying an interviewing for new positions, and one of them is a FAS that will also manage some elements of BD (sales, sales support etc).  The idea of being an FAS is really appealing to me, and I think that I have some interpersonal skills that will work well for such a role.    I've read every thread I can find, but most of them are over 2 years old, so I'm asking again as things are much different in the state of our industry compared to 2022!



I guess the biggest questions on my mind are the travel requirement (50%) and career path beyond FAS.  I am just outside an east coast hub, so I imagine much of my travel will be local, but there will be plenty of travel throughout the eastern US.  For folks who have made this pivot, is it possible to balance family life with 50% travel?  I have two kids and want to be there for them.  Some portion of traveling is realistic, but living out of a suitcase is not- I'd be happy traveling within my hub 5 days a week, but spending 5 days in Texas every other week will be tough.  I will probe during interviews what the specific travel requirements will be, but I'm apprehensive so trying to get a better understanding of what I can expect.



The other is related to the future- some threads mentioned moving to product management, sales or other fields.  Have any of you made such moves, and have they paid off?  Is there long term outlook for such a move, or do most people burn out within two years?  Is there a possibility of moving to a different industry with some BD experience?",29,18,2025-05-09 22:50:56

Gist of it (with limited available details for now) is Medicare spending for individual prescription drugs must be tied in some knowable way to prices paid in other western countries. The objective is to lower prices in the US (I think?).

But if I'm a US-based pharma, wouldn't I raise the prices I charge other countries' healthcare systems so that I don't have to lower Medicare prices as much? Maybe lower prices for Medicare a little, and raise prices in other countries (probably a lot)? This would seem to be the way to optimize revenue.

I wrote to my Congressman in 2019 (or whenever it was) apposing this potential change, but this time around I'm thinking more carefully about it. There should be some parity in pricing between US and other rich countries, shouldn't there? That's not explicitly what this policy is aimed at, but perhaps it's worth considering.

On top of that, I’m starting to feel like retail or hospital pharmacy just isn’t the right long-term fit for me.

So I started looking into master’s programs in Canada and the UK. I reached out to a few Canadian PharmD programs (as a backup plan) + MBiotech @ UofT to see if I’d even be eligible, but most responses were polite rejections. Only one PharmD program encouraged me to apply, but it still feels like a long shot. I’ve also considered doing an MSc in Pharm Sci, but most of those seem really benchwork-heavy. I wouldn’t mind that, but my undergrad only covered basic compounding labs due to limited resources so I’m not sure how competitive I’d be.

I am in what i consider a golden handcuff. i have been in the biotech industry for 6 years (essentially my full adult career).

all 6 years has been in QA of some form. i am currently a quality engineer (or whatever else you want to call it) for validation/CQV work.

this is much better than what i used to do in my previous department/role. but its still not something i see myself doing for life. but i also dont see this as something that has a career path. other than management (which i do not want)

however, as i mentioned, i have ""golden handcuffs"" in place. i have been at the same company for all 6 years. so i have decent benefits.

i also get great pay.

my manager is great.

i am also hybrid with a very flexibility on it as well.

work is easy and not a heavy load on top of that.

everything about it is great and not something i can say has a downside. other than its not something i want for life.

i have a BS in chemical engineer. so i really want to get into something more technical and process related. basically MSAT if it came to biotech.

or ideally, something more closer related to traditional Chemical engineering (mass&energy balance, ASPEN, simulations, design, etc)

the issue is

1. if i want to get into MSAT, i am essentially going to start from the bottom (much less pay) and MUCH more work. probably 200% more work than i do now. i will also have less flexibility when it comes to the hybrid option.

2. i personally dont think its possible for me to get into a traditional chemical engineer related work. the only work experience i have is in biotech and QA only at that. i am WAY behind on what these company's are looking for. but also, this means i have to move (i have looked around in my area. commute is impossible unless i move) and NONE of them are hybrid/remote. its all 100% onsite. for again, less/similar pay, and MUCH more work.

not to mention, due to the current situation when it comes to employment, doing anything else seems like a big risk. and i cant afford to lose employment.

biotech,Will I have my next round (Final) interview?,"Two weeks ago I spoke with recruiter from Millipore sigma for a senior manager role. During call she went over job description, pay expectations all went well. I’ll be talking to four people in total, 1 hour each with two people. During the call recruiter asked my availability for next week which is basically this week and also said they’re looking to fill this role ASAP. Since one of the interviewer is in Australia and other one in US, we scheduled for an early morning interview on Monday. All questions both asked were STAR based and there were sub questions to each question, no technical nothing. Last 15 minutes I was given chance to ask and both of them answered very politely. 


I feel I did a good job, except for a couple of questions. I’m prepared for a couple of STAR based questions not definitely for 45 mins. Hiring manager also mentioned the same about filling the role ASAP. 


After the call, I sent a thank you note to recruiter. Haven’t heard back anything. What are my chances for next round based on how market conditions are and the way hiring managers are expectations are? 

I know it’s hard to predict, I’m trying to get a sense from rest of the folks in job search and how their experience is.

They are concerned that though I mean the scientist criteria I am “devaluing a PhD and would upset the balance of the team” followed by having me report to someone who just finished their post doc. This individual is nice but antisocial and doesn’t communicate so I find myself just collecting a check most morning until he arrives closer to noon. 

The SVP is also very crass saying things there are an HR nightmare but communicating she isn’t sure exactly how to do this as it’s her first time in her role. 

The de facto team lead/ director is first time industry and cannot manage his own schedule let along a team. He has pulled me aside to inform me to “stop asking questions, trying to help, and just pipette.” He informed me that “I might be more senior but I lack a PhD so I am a tech to him.”

I am miserable at this contract role but have a family to worry about. I am applying but the market is so bad and I have not had much luck. My commute to work is also 2 hours a day making this more tiring outside of mentally exhausting. 

Anyone have any advice on what to do? I can’t quit because of my family but this contract role is killing me slowly.

Takeda (commercial only?) is also located in the Pasadena area. I've also seen a couple of smaller biotech companies and several academic institutes.

In addition I applied for a more senior role (got ghosted) that required at least 3-5 years of experience a month before I got contacted for the role that I went through 3 rounds of the interviews for and got rejected. While I was going through the interview process they had the audacity to post roles for the same job, but were a step or two higher for the job I was interviewing for. They wasted my time when I could have been an applicant for a more advanced role that they were hiring for at the same time I was interviewing for this role. 

I’m curious, has anyone ever been told that they are overqualified for the role and may become bored while working there? I personally think that it would have taken me 1-2 years to become bored. My previous role caused me to become bored within 3 months of starting, but I had no new industry experience due to graduating with a BS a few months prior to starting. 

Currently, I’m lacking industry experience since I just did a gap year between degrees (I’m about to graduate with a MS). I have been applying to QC jobs since I’m missing a couple years of industry experience since my academic experience and advanced degrees would allow me to be a senior scientist in a good job market.

biotech,How do I get out of this industry? It’s slowly killing me inside.,"I know I should be grateful to have a job in this economy, but it’s destroying my mental health. I’ve worked in medical writing for about 12 years now and hate everything about it: the monotonous tasks, co-workers (the most drab people I’ve ever met), shitty work/life balance, politics, having to ”mask” that I actually give a shit about the work I do. I just find everything about it so uninspiring. I’m a creative stuck in what I consider the most boring science-industry out there.

I got pushed into this career after college by my dad (who also worked in the industry, but in a different area). He felt as an English major I would be perfect for medical writing (he clearly doesn’t know me very well) and I ended up getting a graduate degree in science writing at his urging. Hindsight is 20/20, but at the time, I didn’t have the strength to stand up to my parents and just went along with whatever life they had envisioned for me. 

I’ve always been drawn to anything creative - performing arts, painting, drawing, sculpture, action sports, creative writing, languages (native-level proficiency in two languages, fluent in two more), traveling, entrepreneurship….all things that are the complete opposite of the work I do now. I also have severe ADHD - while I tend to be very detail-oriented and try my best in the beginning of a new job, I inevitably get bored, my mental health starts to suffer a few months in, and I start making mistakes. I’ve been fired once and placed on a PIP once due to said issues. This tears my mental health down even more, even though I’m great at masking and pretending that everything is great.

It would probably be helpful to have some friends at work, but (hope this doesn’t offend anyone) I just find medical writers to be the most boring people ever. Most are PhDs, rarely travel, have 0% creativity, are excited about being corporate slaves for the rest of their lives, and are so narrow-minded when it comes to anything outside of science. Not well-rounded individuals at all in my opinion. They all remind me of band geeks in high school. I was always into action sports and anything creative in high school so don’t remember ever saying a word to the band geeks…..yet now I’m surrounded by them. The people I’ve interacted with in other departments don’t seem very exciting either. 

I honestly don’t know what to do at this point. I’m a solo parent with a mortgage, so can’t afford to start all over with a low-paying job. I’ve considered suicide many times over the last few years and wondered if my kid would be better off with one of my siblings.",92,121,2025-05-07 13:06:29

biotech,At a Crossroads in Biotech - Looking for advice,"Hi /biotech, 


I’m at a bit of a crossroads in my career and hoping for some insight from others in the industry.

I’ve been working in biotech manufacturing roles for about 4 years now, having started straight out of uni. While the experience has been solid, I feel as though I’ve hit a ceiling in terms of growth and development. I’ve been trying to pivot into other areas, specifically QA or RA, but so far it’s been a bit of a struggle.

Over the past ~6 months, I’ve applied to a number of positions with very little success: a few rejections, some ‘no-responses’, and one interview that didn’t move forward. It’s been discouraging and is starting to wear on my confidence.


A few things about my background:

- BSc in a life science field (not directly related to biotech)
- No Master’s degree (yet)
- Have some QA-relevant experience, e.g. document management


What could I do to make myself a more competitive candidate for QA or RA roles?
Is a lack of formal education beyond a BSc a big turn-off for employers in these areas?
Has anyone here successfully made this kind of transition, if so, how?

Any advice, feedback, or shared experiences would be really appreciated. Happy to clarify anything if needed.

Thanks!",1,1,2025-05-08 10:06:30
biotech,Research Associate in Cancer Research Looking to Transition into Consulting or Equity Research — Seeking Advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently working as a Research Associate in the cancer biology/immunology field at a major biomedical research institute. I have about 2 years of hands-on research experience, and I hold a Master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from an Ivy League university.

While I’ve learned a lot and value the scientific rigor of my current role, I’ve realized I’m more drawn to the strategic, analytical, and business-facing side of science. I’m seriously considering transitioning into life sciences consulting or equity research (especially healthcare or biotech-focused roles).

That said, I’m not sure where to begin with this switch. I’d love to hear from anyone who has made a similar transition or works in these fields. Specifically:
What should I be prepping for (case interviews, modeling, etc.)?
What skills or experience gaps should I address?
How should I position my research background when applying?
Are there any resources or certifications you’d recommend?

Any advice, insight, or even personal stories would be incredibly helpful. Thanks in advance!",0,14,2025-05-08 19:38:57

biotech,I got accepted to PhD after three tries. Now scared of what I've done.,"I got accepted into PhD for plant synthetic biology. This has been my dream since 2014. However, now I'm scared of what I signed on to. It suddenly dawned on me that most biotech companies don't care about plant synthetic biology.

I feel like I wanted so badly to be an expert on something and now I realize how vacantly society sees such expertise. Like, if someone told me that they're pursuing a PhD in primatology or American history, I'd congratulate them but I wouldn't think they're doing anything cool. And now, I'm walking the same path by choosing to study plant synthetic biology. I'm interested in plant cell culture, carotenoids, and synthetic biology. But I could've just read it on my own. Omg I feel so dumb now and I can't undo it.

EDIT: I feel regretful posting this silly post but I also appreciate the answers so I'll keep it up for now.",54,43,2025-05-07 08:57:45
biotech,PhD new grad trying to break into industry - resume suggestions,"Hi all, I'm a long-time lurker on this sub, and thank you for all the expert suggestions on folks' resume! I dug through a lot of older posts to try to improve upon my resume, now that I'm on the job market for a few months with no hits. I am primarily looking for scientist positions, but tbh at this point will take anything where my skills are transferrable.

I tried really hard to get ""industry experience"" earlier on in my PhD, offering to volunteer, but was not successful due to being on a student visa (I just got my green card though). So my ""experience"" is academic at most, and I've really struggled with ""quantifying"" my work and not coming across like I am just listing what I did without considering impact. I also struggle with what to leave out in terms of contextualizing it to show that I am capable of 1) transitioning outside of academia; 2) pick up unfamiliar work and hit the ground running; and 3) bring a diverse skillset. You'll know what I mean when you see the ""collaborated with bioinformatics team"" point in my experience section, I was really lost over that one.

I asked 2 different career offices to look at my resume with an Abbvie scientist listing as reference and this is what I have right now. It's not completely tailored but I would love your feedback. Constructive criticism appreciated!

Advice I have gotten so far - I have a name that is very obviously Asian, and my family has been telling me to A/B test applications with an alias that has a ""whiter"" first name. My husband is a software engineer and says I need to apply with a one-page resume, but the career office folks say two pages. I had a skills section but the career office removed that, saying the professional summary was enough.

Thank you so much!

My mom was confused about why I think there aren’t other jobs since the president has a big initiative to cure for cancer. So that’s it right there- they don’t see that the gov funding is gone, they think it’s more I guess. And they don’t see how the lack of stability means a hesitancy to invest in R&D (which my CEO pointed out recently). And we didn’t even get to how they probably think jobs are overall being brought home to us or the tariff impacts. Ugh but I’m sure you guys get it.",1330,286,2025-05-06 13:47:52
biotech,How can an undergrad pivot? Any ideas?,"
I am a Biology undergrad in the U.S. who goes to a middling school with a very unremarkable GPA. I’ve got three semesters left. I have a lot of research experience (will have a lot more in the next year or so), two posters, many hours in the lab, but my name is not on any serious papers and likely never will be from now until the time I graduate. I have landed zero internships and have very few industry connections. My original goal was to get into research, go to graduate school, and then have a career as an industry scientist but after reading this subreddit for the last year or so, listening to people in the field and having a girlfriend that I’d like to buy a nice wedding ring for, I’m realizing that this dream is likely pretty dead in the water in 2025 and onwards. I love biology, I love chemistry, I love the lab, I love research, but because of this I sorely regret my choice of major. It’s a little sad, because I am the kind of person who skims through science journals every day and the time I get to spend in the lab is my favorite part of every day maybe barring time spent with the gf and certain friends but it’s well and truly whatever at this point.

I’m thinking I’m going to have to pivot to something else after college. Does anybody have any input as to what the best avenues should be? I was thinking about sales of some sort but I don’t know where I’d even get entry level experience. At this point I have totally emotionally deadened myself on so many levels and am willing to do whatever it takes, sell my soul to whoever I need to to avoid having to go back to working in restaurants for the rest of my life and join the middle class that I was born into. All ideas welcome.

biotech,Considering Digital Nomad Life—How much will a Career Gap Hurt?,"Hi all, I’m a chemical engineering PhD specializing in microfluidics/microfab/nanofab with \~2 years of industry experience at a biotech startup and a patent under my belt. I’m strongly considering trying a digital nomad lifestyle for 1-2 years to travel (US, Japan) and explore remote work, possibly consulting or a side project like a microfluidic UI tool. I love the idea of freedom and global exposure, but I’m nervous about how a career gap might look if I return to biotech or academia.

My main worries:

* Will employers (industry or academia) judge a gap if I step away from hands-on microfluidics work? My field moves fast, and I don’t want to seem “out of touch.”
* How do I stay relevant during a gap? I’m thinking of part-time consulting or online courses, but is that enough?
* Has anyone here taken a break (nomad or otherwise) and returned to a niche biotech field? How did you frame the gap, and were there hurdles?

I’m planning to test nomading for 6 months initially, maybe mixing travel with remote gigs to keep one foot in the field. Any advice on:

* Managing career gaps in microfluidics/biotech?
* Remote opportunities for microfluidics experts (consulting, freelancing, etc.)?
* How to pitch nomad experience (e.g., global perspective, entrepreneurial skills) when re-entering the job market?

Would love to hear from PhDs, biotech folks, or nomads who’ve navigated this! Deeply appreciate and welcome any insights.  ",0,3,2025-05-08 00:08:40

I basically broke myself for this degree and now I mix basic buffers and measure pH values like a god damm first semester.

biotech,What now…,"So I just accepted a really good position at what I thought was a great company ~2 months ago. Required a cross country move (which they paid for) but the job was so great for me that I packed up my life and went for it. 

I have been officially working the position for 3 weeks. I received an e-mail at 7:00pm today that my position is no more and I was being laid off. Was told today was my last day and not to return to the office. They implied tariffs/general political climate was to blame. Boss called me to let me know our entire team has been laid off, along with a decent chunk of the rest of the company. Completely blindsided.

I don’t even know where to go from here. I don’t understand how they could have such a lack of foresight. Maybe I’m just naive, but i would’ve thought moving an employee 3000 miles so that they can work for your company implies that you want them there/are able to have them there long term, or at least more than a month.

So here I am, 3000 miles away from home, new lease and we haven’t even finished unpacking yet, trying to apply for unemployment that I may not qualify for because I haven’t lived/worked in the state long enough. But as far as they are concerned, a 1 month severance package suffices.
