Both China and the United States have said that they've made progress at trade talks between the two countries in Switzerland.

The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as ""productive and constructive,"" while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng said the talks were ""in-depth"" and ""candid"".

The pair were engaged in secretive closed-door discussions all weekend, in the first meeting since US President Donald Trump levied steep tariffs against China in January.

The talks were the first face-to-face meetings between the two countries since President Trump imposed a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, with Beijing responding with a 125% levy some US goods.

The huge tariffs caused turmoil in the financial markets and sparked fears of a global recession.

Full details from the talks will be jointly released on Monday.

Following the conclusion of the two-day talks in Geneva, US trade representative ambassador Jamieson Greer said ""the deal we struck with our Chinese partners"" would help reduce the US's $1.2tn (£901bn) trade deficit.

Mr Bessent said the US and China have made ""substantial progress"" on de-escalating the trade war, while Vice Premier He said the talks were ""of great significance to the two countries but also have an important impact on the stability and development of the global economy"".

He told reporters in Geneva that the meetings had been substantive, Reuters reported.

Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, inspector general of the World Trade Organization, called the talks ""a significant step forward.""

""I urge both nations to build on this momentum by continuing to develop practical solutions that mitigate tensions, restore predictability, and strengthen confidence in the multilateral trading system,"" she said in a statement.

On Saturday, following the first day of talks Trump praised the ""total reset"" on the relationship between the two countries.

In a social media post, the US president described the talks as being ""very good"" and said change had been ""negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner"".

""We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!"" Trump added.

An escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing has seen the US president hit Chinese imports to the US with tariffs of 145%. China retaliated with levies of 125% on some US goods.

On Friday, before the talks began, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Washington would not lower tariffs unilaterally, and China would need to make its own concessions.

Both sides issued various other warnings ahead of the meeting, with Beijing saying the US must ease tariffs while Bessent stressed that the focus was on ""de-escalation"" and this was not a ""big trade deal"".

Chinese state media reported that Beijing had decided to engage with the US after fully considering global expectations, the country's interests and appeals from American businesses.",582,230,2025-05-12 03:04:48,"China confirms trade talks were constructive, joint statement expected today https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn053edex5eo

stocks,"People need to start taking Trump literally - When he says buy, you should buy","I'm not in the US but I've been following Trump closely for the last few months. One thing that's becoming increasingly clear is that he's actually relatively predictable, because if he says he will do something he will generally do it. Take 'Liberation Day' as an example. He signalled that tariffs were going to be very high for days and weeks before the event. To me, it was quite obvious that the market was going to tank, and low and behold, it did.

Then, after Trump and his cronies made off with millions in shorts (speculation), he says ""NOW IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY"". As it turned out, it was in fact, a great time to buy, because mere hours later, he came out with the market pumping news that he was suspending all tariffs (except the global 10% one), for 90 days.

Then, on Friday, before this big China meeting in Switzerland, he does the exact same thing. ""THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY"", preceded by the news that tariffs were dropped to 30% (i.e. what they were before April). Markets have already pumped 3% this morning.

I've been saying for a while that people need to take him literally, and he's proved the theory right again.

stocks,"Trade war is about more than just trade, China’s official news agency argues","China's official state news agency argued that the ongoing trade war between the United States and China is about much more than tariffs.

""At its heart, this is not just a trade dispute - it is an encounter between two fundamentally different visions in this age of economic globalization: one rooted in openness, cooperation and shared growth; the other driven by confrontation, exclusion, and zero-sum mentality,"" Xinhua wrote in commentary published early Sunday.

stocks,Impact of US policy on stocks,"I've identified 10 economic issues facing the United States that I would like to talk about. Each of these issues reduce economic growth. I would be curious to know what everyone thinks about these issues.

1. Tourism - Typically, the US generates ~2 trillion in revenue from tourism per year. Overall, tourism is down around 13% this year. However, tourism from some countries are seeing a sharper drop. For example, Canadian tourism to the US is down around 30%. So far, this is expected to shrink the US economy by ~$200 billion. Additionally, seven commercial airplanes have crashed since Trump took office. Domestic and international travel is down.

2. Boycotts - People from other countries are boycotting US products due to their discontentment with the US. This discontent seems to be due to two factors. First, the US is transitioning from a constitutional republic to a totalitarian oligarchy. This is unpopular domestically and abroad. Second, tariffs have impacted foreign economies. For example, German auto workers are being laid off because their cars aren't being sold in the US as much. Canada has seem rising unemployment partially due to the tariffs too. Other countries will be impacted too. Ultimately, I don't know how much boycotting by foreigners will impact the US economy, but it is happening.

3. Debt (government, consumer, student) - US treasuries are being sold by foreign countries. This means that the US government must provide a greater return for US treasuries to entice foreign investment. This will reduce government spending because the government will be forced to spend more to repay it's debt.

Consumer debt is extremely high too. Consumers owe ~$1.6 trillion on their cars, and ~1.2 trillion on their credit cards. When consumers repay this debt, they are not expanding the economy. Instead, it's just a drain on the economy.

The White House has indicated that ~5 million student loans barrowers will have their wages garnished to repay their student loan debt. The Internet told me the average monthly payment for a student loan is $536/month. I think that seems high. I only pay $192/month. Still, these are barrowers who are unable to repay their student loans. All of their money is going to necessities or servicing debt. Now, they'll have less money to expand the economy.

4. Economic uncertainty - US tariff policy has been changing on a daily basis. Investors favor economies that are stable politically and economically. It's impossible to make long-term plans when policy can change on a daily basis. It's no wonder that corporation have been expanding into foreign economies when it's impossible to make a long-term plan due to policy changes. I don't have any numbers on how this could impact the economy, but it should be a drag. US consumers have been more conservative with their spending too amid recession fears.

5. Immigration - There are 47.8 million immigrants in the US. That's around 1/7 of the population. ~11 million are undocumented immigrants. ~750 are forcibly removed per day. However, immigrants are voluntarily fleeing the US due to negative sentiment about immigrants and dangers posed by the administration. It's unclear how many are leaving, but there have been worker shortages in meat packing and agriculture which are largely run by undocumented immigrants. Undocumented immigrants payed almost $100 billion in federal taxes last year with around a 8% effective tax rate. That means that they expanded the economy by over a trillion dollars.

Documented immigrants produce more for the economy than undocumented immigrants. Being able to immigrate to another country implies that a person has enough money to do so or that they have a valuable skill. ICE has been removing documented immigrants from the country too. These are people that typically produce more for the economy than the average citizen. Removing members from this group or discouraging others from immigrating to the US is a massive drain on the economy.

6. Federal worker firings - Somewhere between 120,000 and 250,000 federal workers have been fired by DOGE. These workers are largely now entering the private sector.

7. Transportation sector firings - UPS has fired 20,000 truck drivers. Also, imports have dropped ~1/3. There are around 85,000 longshoremen in the US. They may need to fire 20,000-30,000 in the near future.

8. Social security - Social security benefits have not been cut, but it's become harder to receive benefits due to DOGE. Many offices have closed. Phone lines have been cut. And, the social security website has gone down several times. Many seniors and disabled people have been missing their checks and have had little recourse to receive their benefits again. Also, social security will not pay for missed months. If a check is missed for a month, then the individual just needs to try and figure out how to get their check next month. Social security pays ~67 million people each ~$2,000/month (depending on several factors). A missed payment means that a family may need to cut their spending which shrinks the economy.

9. Political instability - Everything I've already mentioned is in the realm of politics. The other items I've listed are political, but I imagine I'll get the most push back for this item. The US is undergoing a coup. The administration has disobeyed a SCOTUS order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcias. So far, the White House has refused this order. Constitutional amendments, the right to due process, and birthright citizenship have all entered the sphere of what is considered political. Under the constitution of the US, none of these items are in question. However, the administration is attacking these items and more.

Coups can be very bad for business. Protests have been enormous. There's talk of having a general strike. Politically motivated violence is increasing. This directs resources away from expanding the economy.

10. Tariffs - A lot can be said about the tariffs. I've mentioned them a few times already. Imports have dropped by around a third. This is likely to be an inflationary pressure on the economy. People may not be able to find the items they want. It's bad bad bad. Real bad. Bad bad.

To be fair, there are some impacts on the economy that increase the value of stocks. For example, de-dollarization means that US goods are cheaper abroad. The dollar has already lost ~15% of its value since the Trump administration. This encourages foreign investment because it's easier for foreigners to get dollars to buy US treasuries or stocks. I may be inclined to make another post about impacts that are expected to increase the value of stocks.

stocks,US inflation starting to stir as Trump tariffs hit,"From Bloomberg: US consumer prices probably picked up in April after the smallest advance in nine months, foreshadowing a broader acceleration as many companies seek to pass on higher tariffs.

A closely watched gauge of prices paid by Americans for goods and services, excluding volatile food and energy costs, is forecast to have risen 0.3%, based on a Bloomberg survey of economists. In March, the so-called core consumer price index inched up just 0.1%. 

While Tuesday’s report is likely to show limited pass-through so far of higher US duties on imported goods, many economists anticipate the impact becoming more pronounced over time.

That helps explains growing apprehension among consumers about inflation specifically and the economy and job market more broadly. Retail sales due Thursday are expected to show some of that anxiety; after a healthy 1.5% jump at the end of the first quarter, economists forecast little change in April sales as front-loaded demand for motor vehicles cooled.

For their part, companies are threading the needle between attempting to mitigate the costs of tariffs through price hikes, and trying to guard against a drop in sales as consumers recoil from sticker shock.

stocks,Does Market Sentiment always change this fast in the stock market? I find incredibly amazing how things swung in just one month.,"So I am not gonna lie, I start investing in January, and I got bodied by liberation day and I panic sold because I was not able to witness and stomach such tremendous losses because I targeted individual stocks and I lost a lot, and I mean a lot, of money.

That's another story though, and I accepted that and need to grow obviously. I wish I didn't start investing at 27 though, but you live and you learn.

But the thing that shocks me, with my small amount of experience in the market, is how quickly the sentiment changes from April to now. We went from liberation day crashes and basically everyone fearing the world ending, to now, on this day, a deal with China coming in and every day the stock market pumped with a new headline.

I don't have much experience, but in previous large drops in the market, is this always the case that recovery happens this quick and sentiment can change drastically in a month? Or is this a unique scenario of what's going on right now?

stocks,Warren Buffett’s 1965 investors: From $100 to $5.5 million By Investing.com,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKb) remains one of the most extraordinary success stories in corporate and investment history. From humble beginnings, a $100 investment in Berkshire shares back in 1965—when Buffett took control—would have grown to $5.5 million by the end of last year, according to the company’s own figures.

That compares to just $39,000 had the same amount been placed in an S&P 500 index fund with dividends reinvested. The gap illustrates not just outperformance, but a staggering wealth-creation machine that has compounded investor capital at roughly double the rate of the market for six decades.


“The one problem with the investment business is that things don’t come along in an orderly fashion, and they never will,” Buffett said at the most recent annual shareholder meeting. “We’re running a business which is very, very, very opportunistic.”

In a year in which he decided to finally step down as the company’s CEO, Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio reflects Buffett’s enduring investment principles: a focus on companies with strong fundamentals, long-term growth potential, and a commitment to holding investments over extended periods.

stocks,Confused with how short selling stocks works,"I understand what is happening in short selling. An investor expects a share price to drop. So they borrow some shares, immediately sell them, and hope to buy them back for cheaper. Making profit.

Here's what I don't get:

1. What does borrowing shares actually mean?? Are you actually given the shares?? Does the lender actually hand them over to you??

2. For short selling to work, the investor needs to be able to return the shares he's borrowed. But how does the investor know he can always buy these shares back?? What if the person he just sold those shares to doesn't want to sell them back?? Are there situations where the investor can't find any shares to give back?? What happens then??

3. Why would anyone want to lend shares for short selling?? Surely the idea of having shares is to make money from them. But for short selling to work it means shares lose money. For example. Lets say I borrow one share worth $100. I sell it. The share price crashes to $40. I buy it back and return the share. So I make $60 profit. This great for me. But the guy who's lent me the share has just lost $60 on his assets. How does the lender deal with that loss??

stocks,Trump has threatened to place a 100% tariff on Barbie maker Mattel,"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-threatens-barbie-100-percent-tariff-2070023

> President Donald Trump has threatened to place a 100 percent tariff on Barbie maker Mattel, after the company's CEO said it would continue to manufacture outside the U.S. but would be reducing its reliance on Chinese imports. ""I've heard [Mattel] said: 'Well we're going to go counter, we're going to try going someplace else,' "" Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday.

stocks,A message to this sub,"I just want to say a big thank you to all the speculators, doomers & emotional folks who decided to sell off their stocks and portfolios over a manufactured issue that was fixable.

While you were all speculating on macroeconomic conditions & staring at photos of empty ports, I was scooping up all your shares at dirt cheap prices. 

To be a bit more specific, American Express at 15 P/E and META at 19 P/E was just a straight steal. Anybody with half a brain and a bit of experience in this market could've figured that out.

Anyone with even a shred of market experience could see that several of the “Magnificent 7” stocks were also trading well below their intrinsic value. It wasn’t rocket science - it was one of the most obvious profit opportunities staring people in the face. But as usual, most were too busy panicking over headlines or chasing the next shiny object to notice.

Thank you for helping me make profits.

And for my fellow *investors* who stayed the course and managed to make a profit, congratulations to you too.

Now I know there's gonna be a flood of doomers and speculators commenting 'just wait and see, this is the beginning of a bigger crash'.

Yeah no worries, even if stocks were to fall 50% off a cliff in the next year I'll continue scooping up what you discard.

Please don’t roast me too much but here’s the formula I came up with and some reasoning 

Total assets (20.38) minus total liabilities(16.28) equals 4.1 divided by market cap (1.94) equals 2.11. Stock price of 9.38 multiplied by 2.11 equals *$19.79* is what I’m valuing the stock at. I did this because if the stock is trading at $9.38 with a market cap of 1.94B but total assets minus total liabilities is 4.1B, then theoretically it’s trading at a discount right? Or no?

stocks,CrowdStrike Faces Federal Investigation: Stock Tumbles Amid Government Probe into $32M IRS Deal,"CrowdStrike, a leading name in cybersecurity, saw its stock tumble this week following reports of a federal investigation into a major government contract. The probe centers around a $32 million software deal tied to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), sparking investor concerns about the company’s business practices and future government partnerships.

According to sources close to the matter, the Department of the Treasury’s inspector general is investigating the role [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/) played in a procurement process that allegedly skipped competitive bidding rules. The deal was executed through Carahsoft, a major government IT contractor, and involved CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity software being fast-tracked into IRS systems.

The issue? Investigators are trying to determine if the deal improperly bypassed [federal acquisition regulations](https://www.acquisition.gov/), which require fair competition for most government contracts. So far, no formal accusations have been made, but the existence of an active investigation is enough to rattle stakeholders.

Once news of the probe broke, CrowdStrike’s stock dropped by nearly 5% in intraday trading. The sharp decline reflects investor anxiety over potential reputational damage, contract delays, or future revenue losses tied to government scrutiny.

This development comes at a time when CrowdStrike is viewed as a major player in protecting public and private institutions from cyber threats. Any disruption to that perception could shift market dynamics in favor of competitors.

# What This Means for the Cybersecurity Industry

Government contracts are a huge revenue source for cybersecurity firms. But as this situation highlights, they can also come with regulatory risks. The scrutiny CrowdStrike now faces serves as a warning to other tech firms: follow proper procurement procedures, or face financial and legal consequences.

Analysts say this probe might not spell long-term doom for CrowdStrike, especially if no wrongdoing is ultimately found. Still, it’s a reminder that trust and transparency are as critical as innovation in today’s tech-driven economy.",204,29,2025-05-10 00:14:54,"CrowdStrike Faces Federal Investigation: Stock Tumbles Amid Government Probe into $32M IRS Deal CrowdStrike, a leading name in cybersecurity, saw its stock tumble this week following reports of a federal investigation into a major government contract.

What do we actually think the result of this is going to be? Even if tariffs remain at 80%, that would still be insanely high and essentially kill a bunch of US manufacturing particularly most tech stuff.

I'm sure China's position was that tariffs need to be zero before any serious discussions were to begin. I honestly don't know why they're bothering to negotiate with this buffoon.

If it's the same as the UK deal (which essentially reversed the tariffs on the UK economy as it protected all key industries involved), then we'll basically see tariffs be essentially rolled back to what they were a few months ago with some extra steps thrown in.

stocks,Don’t let your hatred for Trump cloud your judgment on the market and make you invest with your emotions,"Reddit overwhelmingly hates Trump and with good reason. That being said you can't have that hatred of Trump cloud your judgment.

Fundamentally, those who hate Trump believe that his policies and tariffs will tank the market. If the market doesn't tank or dip as much as Reddit expects, it causes cognitive dissonance because Trumps economy is not as bad as people thought it would be. This fundamentally causes an internal conflict because it means you're wrong about Trumps impact on the economy.

So far the tariffs impact haven't been fully felt but in addition the market has bounced back a lot better than this sub thought it would. There are two possibilities:

- It's totally possible that we're in for a lot more pain in the future once tariffs really go into effect and it crashes the market.

- It's also possible that Trumps tariff rhetoric and implementation isn't as harmful to the market as people think and perhaps Wall Street think/is confident that the tariff thing will stabilize and be figured out. This naturally will not tank the market as much. 


None of us are smart enough tbh to know what is more likely, but emotionally Reddit will have a natural inclination to believe the first option because it reinforces their view that Trump is horrible for the economy and country. I implore you to not let this bias cloud your judgment because the second option is also possible that the worst is over with the tariff stuff.

wallstreetbets,Trump executive order: Prescription drug prices to be reduced by 30% to 80% almost immediately,"President Donald Trump announced Sunday that he plans to resurrect a controversial policy from his first term that aims to reduce drug costs by basing payments for certain medicines on their prices in other countries.

His prior rule, called “Most Favored Nation,” was finalized in late 2020 but blocked by federal courts and rescinded by then-President Joe Biden in 2021. It would have applied to Medicare payments for certain drugs administered in doctors’ offices. However, it is unclear what payments or drugs the new directive would apply to.

In a Truth Social post Sunday evening, Trump said he plans to sign an executive order Monday morning that he argues would drastically lower drug prices.

“I will be signing one of the most consequential Executive Orders in our Country’s history. Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%,” he wrote. “I will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION’S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World.”

The directive comes as the Trump administration is also looking to impose tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, which had been exempted from such levies enacted during the president’s first term. The tariffs could exacerbate shortages of certain drugs, particularly generic medicines, and eventually raise prices.

If the new executive order is comparable to the 2020 rule, both Medicare and its beneficiaries could see savings. But it could also limit patients’ access to medications, experts said. Much depends on how the policy is structured.

Although lowering drug prices was a major talking point of his first administration, Trump has not focused on the topic as much this term. And his campaign told Politico last year that he had moved away from the “Most Favored Nation” model, which many Republicans strongly oppose.

But the administration revived the idea recently as a potential way to meet deep spending cut targets for Medicaid in the House GOP’s sweeping tax and spending cuts package. However, it’s unclear whether the proposal will be included in the legislation, the details of which should be announced shortly, or whether it would be covered by the executive order.

The initiative will likely face stiff opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which successfully halted the first iteration.

The Trump administration introduced the idea of tying Medicare’s drug reimbursements to the prices in other countries in 2018 and finalized the rule just after the 2020 election. The seven-year model would have allowed the US to piggyback on discounts negotiated by other peer countries, which typically pay far less for medications in large part because their governments often determine the cost.

Under the 2020 initiative, Medicare would have paid the lowest price available among those peer countries for 50 Part B drugs that are administered in doctors’ offices. The administration estimated it would have saved about $86 billion.

At the time, Medicare was barred from negotiating drug prices, but that changed with the 2022 passage of the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act, which gave Medicare the historic power to bargain over prices for a small number of drugs annually.

A “Most Favored Nation” proposal could save beneficiaries’ money in their out-of-pocket costs and their premiums, which are both affected by the price of drugs, experts said.

wallstreetbets,Huge dip Monday as details of trade talks come out,"The only reason to announce this ""huge"" reduction in the cost of medications (with absolutely no detail about it except that other countries are paying for it, kind of like Mexico with the wall I guess) is because they know the details of what they release on Monday will cause a dip. Markets are pumping right now on hope, slowly drip fed out by this administration. But the timing on this one seems odd to me. I will wait until things settle out in the morning, maybe the first half hour after open or so. Then I plan to grab some puts for this week. I expect after what they release we will be back around the 565 range.  

To be clear, I am not saying that things went bad. I just don't think there was any kind of ""reset"" or that anything really moved forward. These initial meetings are almost always just hashing out exactly what is going to be discussed, what is on and off the table, etc. Here is a quote from an article I was just reading on this:

""I would caution against too much reading of the tea leaves,"" according to Dmitry Grozoubinski, a former Australian trade negotiator based in Geneva. ""It's probably more likely that they agreed on what their conversation should cover — on what are the kind of things they are both prepared to discuss.""",510,398,2025-05-12 03:17:49,"Huge dip Monday as details of trade talks come out The only reason to announce this ""huge"" reduction in the cost of medications (with absolutely no detail about it except that other countries are paying for it, kind of like Mexico with the wall I guess) is because they know the details of what they release on Monday will cause a dip.

wallstreetbets,"Google Charizard TA Analysis - Flamethrower and Dragon Dance Detected, $185+ Breakout","HERE IS MY NEW ANALYSIS EVERYONE HAS BEEN WAITING FOR.  
  
Over the last few weeks… bruh... Google has been **DRAGON DANCING**. Sacrificing short-term gains to buff its *long-term attack and movement speed stats*.

Like my analysis on hims, Charizard earlier was doing premature flamethrowers, unable to impress the other step-dragons because of it's lack of fore, I mean preparation. That’s right. Not consolidating. Not pulling back. **CHARGING. ITS. STATS.**  
  
This is shown by the wiggles downward from the 1W candles. But this isn’t weakness — it’s a *setup*. Because of this, Google stock will do 1.5X the gains and 1.5X movement after casting DRAGON DANCE TWICE for a total of 3x gains, 3x speed in total.

Now here’s where it gets 🔥**SERIOUS**🔥:

At $157, the chart shows **resistance forming a textbook Metapod Cluster Formation** — known for attempting to **Harden** and slow bullish momentum.

BUT…

**CHARIZARD HAS FULLY FORMED ON THE CHART.** **FULLY FKING ERECT.**  
  
That means Google stock will use FLAMETHROWER at the $157 resistance along with the 3X speed and damage from Dragon Dance to burn that past the bearish METAPODS who try hardening at that price.

For this very reason, I bought $100k in Google 2026 Calls. Fire-breathing dragon with 3x buffs isn't just Bullish like a Taurus or Bearish like an Usurang— it’s LITERALLY A LEVEL 100 DRAGON THAT WILL 1 SHOT ANYTHING IN ITS WAY, so DRAGONISH.   
  
**🌀 TLDR: Dragon Dance has been used TWICE. Google will use Flamethrower at $157.  CHARZARD FULLY ERECT ON CHART, EYES GLOWING TAIL BLAIZING. Google $200 imminent.** 

\_

if you were curious about my track record, I'm 100% accurate on my charting - Batman TA, Shaft TA, and intellectual superiority in the past two weeks have been reflected in 50%+ stock price moves.

This is shown by the wiggles downward from the 1W candles. But this isn’t weakness — it’s a *setup*. Because of this, Google stock will do 1.5X the gains and 1.5X movement after casting DRAGON DANCE TWICE for a total of 3x gains, 3x speed in total.

Now here’s where it gets 🔥**SERIOUS**🔥:

At $157, the chart shows **resistance forming a textbook Metapod Cluster Formation** — known for attempting to **Harden** and slow bullish momentum.

BUT…

**CHARIZARD HAS FULLY FORMED ON THE CHART.** **FULLY FKING ERECT.**  
  
That means Google stock will use FLAMETHROWER at the $157 resistance along with the 3X speed and damage from Dragon Dance to burn that past the bearish METAPODS who try hardening at that price.

For this very reason, I bought $100k in Google 2026 Calls. Fire-breathing dragon with 3x buffs isn't just Bullish like a Taurus or Bearish like an Usurang— it’s LITERALLY A LEVEL 100 DRAGON THAT WILL 1 SHOT ANYTHING IN ITS WAY, so DRAGONISH.   
  
**🌀 TLDR: Dragon Dance has been used TWICE. Google will use Flamethrower at $157.  CHARZARD FULLY ERECT ON CHART, EYES GLOWING TAIL BLAIZING. Google $200 imminent.** 

\_

if you were curious about my track record, I'm 100% accurate on my charting - Batman TA, Shaft TA, and intellectual superiority in the past two weeks have been reflected in 50%+ stock price moves.

# Inflation, Retail Sales Reports Come As Investors Watch Data Amid Tariff Developments

The weekend meetings on trade between U.S. and Chinese officials are likely to capture market watchers’ attention to start the week, with investors hopeful that trade tensions between the two nations could be easing.

Inflation will be in focus as investors get their first look at April prices with the Tuesday release of the [Consumer Price Index (CPI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp). At last week’s Federal Reserve meeting, officials said they were looking for more improvement on inflation before moving to lower interest rates from their current levels.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on Thursday; last week, President Trump was critical of the Fed for failing to act on interest rates. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller, and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly are among the other officials expected to deliver remarks this week.

March’s CPI report indicated that inflation [dropped unexpectedly to a rise of 2.4%](https://www.investopedia.com/inflation-unexpectedly-fell-in-march-amid-tariff-turmoil-11712611), while other recent indicators have [shown that price increases are slowing](https://www.investopedia.com/inflation-was-flat-in-march-pce-measure-shows-11724760). Investors are also expecting updates on import and export prices, as well as April’s Producer Price Index, which shows inflation at the wholesale level.

Retail sales data, scheduled for Thursday, comes as consumer spending has been strong while shoppers [rush to buy items](https://www.investopedia.com/will-consumer-fears-show-up-in-the-march-retail-sales-report-11714988) before tariffs take hold. Economists are looking for signs of change in spending levels, with recent consumer sentiment surveys showing that feelings about the economy are worsening.

On Friday, the latest sentiment report is expected to offer May's first look at how consumers feel about current and future economic conditions. The survey offers insights into spending patterns that can help support the economy. It follows several months of [surveys showing declining consumer sentiment](https://www.investopedia.com/falling-consumer-confidence-has-set-off-this-recession-alarm-11724208) amid worries over the administration's tariffs' impact on prices. Tuesday’s expected small business sentiment report could further signal the economy’s direction.

The homebuilders' confidence survey, scheduled for Thursday, and Friday’s expected housing starts data, will highlight inventory supply trends during a period in which housing scarcity is helping [drive affordability problems](https://www.investopedia.com/want-a-view-of-the-housing-affordability-crisis-these-numbers-show-the-trend-11688451).

Investors will also be looking at Thursday’s scheduled industrial productivity report for data on the manufacturing sector. Monday’s planned release of the monthly federal budget for April will provide an update on government debt levels.

# Walmart Earnings Come as Investors Watch for Consumer Spending Trends

Walmart’s scheduled quarterly report on Thursday leads the weekly earnings calendar, as market watchers seek information on consumer spending and economic conditions amid [uncertain U.S. trade policy](https://www.investopedia.com/walmart-costco-likely-to-fare-well-under-tariffs-ubs-says-11708483).

The retail giant reported prior-quarter earnings per share and revenue that came in ahead of analyst expectations, but its [outlook was weaker than expected](https://www.investopedia.com/walmart-earnings-q4-fy25-11681695) as the company said it was evaluating the impact of tariffs on its business.

Cisco is expected to report on Wednesday after the network infrastructure provider posted higher revenue in the prior quarter on [increased AI orders](https://www.investopedia.com/cisco-earnings-q2-fy2025-11678867) and approved a $15 billion increase to the company’s [stock repurchase](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/041702.asp) program. Semiconductor maker Applied Materials’ report scheduled for Thursday comes after it said in its [previous quarterly earnings report](https://www.investopedia.com/applied-materials-stock-slips-on-predicted-china-sales-headwinds-11679922) in February that sales could be negatively affected by recent limitations on chip exports.

Take-Two Interactive’s Thursday earnings report will drop as the video game maker builds excitement for its [latest release](https://www.investopedia.com/a-new-gta-trailer-has-take-two-stock-rising-again-today-11729304) in the Grand Theft Auto game franchise. Deere’s report on the same day will provide a look at the agricultural sector.

Nuclear power startup Oklo’s report on Tuesday comes after it recently reported that its [losses widened in 2024](https://www.investopedia.com/oklo-stock-sinks-as-losses-widen-reversing-some-of-monday-gains-11702768). Investors in the power provider include OpenAI’s Sam Altman, which has raised investor optimism that the company’s services could be used to [meet energy demand for AI infrastructure projects](https://www.investopedia.com/trump-announces-usd500b-ai-joint-venture-with-oracle-openai-and-softbank-8778027).

Investors will also be following scheduled earnings reports from Chinese e-commerce companies Alibaba, [JD.com](http://JD.com), and Tencent Music Entertainment.

I have 600k in cash (monetary etf) and it's been a while. 

I felt like markets were overvalued back in nevember and I decided to sell it all even if the profit I got was really small, like 15k. 

When the tariffs came, I felt I was right but I thought another 10% was coming so I waited and I lost a huge opportunity and I feel a complete idiot cause the small crash we had was what I was waiting for and I didn't have the balls to profit from it. Now I feel I'd only be fomoing in therefore I stop myself.

I gambled 50k in options (only buying, never selling) but I didn't make any money, I didn't lose either.

Now I know this isn't the place to talk investments but I'm sure a lot of you found themselves in this situation and maybe you can help w the emotional part of it.

I think I'll still wait for a correction to put ''big'' money in the markets and I'll still gamble that 50k to have fun and feel part of this community I've been in for months, almost every day.

wallstreetbets,25-20% or lower China tarrif announcement on Monday? IMO high chance.,"It could be a huge rally tomorrow if what I think turns out to be right. The embargo level tarrif of 145% currently in place re China will cause a recession if not immediately lowered. Since lowering it to 80% (like Trump suggested via Truth a few days ago) or even 50% is still embargo level, it make sense that there is a high chance its way lower than the market expects, think 25-20% or lower! This would also make it easy for the Chinese to accept the deal, since they wont lose face (they want 0% after all). If the Chinese accepted 50%, its still embargo level, and they might think thats not saving face. I.e. the necessity of having to reduce the tarrif to a non embargo level plus China wanting to save face, means that it might be near 25-20% or lower, which would come as a positive shock to the market (think 5% rally on the S&P).

Announcing a nothing burger like some think is unlikely, as there is enormous pressure to lower the tarrif immediately to lift the embargo. Otherwise shortages and a recession awaits.",2,181,2025-05-11 23:21:01,"25-20% or lower China tarrif announcement on Monday? IMO high chance.

wallstreetbets,BTC correlation to market,"Sort of a yolo for me I guess since these are all June Calls. I pivoted most of my HOOD May Calls to June and used funds to get MSTR June calls.

Still feel more upside to resolving tariffs than downside (at least progress) money on sidelines really want to push market up.

I like BTC related trade right now because if things do go poorly with tariffs, it’s actually a bit less downward volatile compared to something like QQQ. In fact, it could slowly shift to becoming a “safety” trade to preserve capital. 

Years ago I would have felt BTC would be a flight to safety like Gold or Swiss Franc. But it actually is positively correlated and even a bit less volatile lately. So I look at BTC more after hours than after hours pricing.

For instance, just had a small jump up when China talks said they’d resume Sunday. (And didn’t blow up). Trading solidly above $100k and may break $105k this week given the momentum.

I don’t own BTC but MSTR is a proxy. Even HOOD is a proxy since crypto trades are so profitable. But BTC is still a good indicator for overall market. At least I tell myself that on a weekend :)

One last note… people don’t understand MSTr earnings. They are basically based on BTC profits. Q1 saw a drop so major negative earnings. But by April, already shifted positive. So Q2 will be massive profitability. It’s expected given BTC above $100k but again, many people don’t get that and will see huge beat. I’ll probably exit MSTR early June in any bit up day. Re-enter on any pull back to roll forward to catch q2 earnings.

investing,Non Residency based insurance platforms - UK resident moving abroad,"Hi All, 

I'm currently a UK resident, investing with Vanguard in an ISA.

I'm moving abroad next year, to a country in which I hold citizenship, and I know that even though I am a UK citizen, I will lose the right to invest in my ISA, so I need to start looking for alternatives. 

I was wondering if anyone knows of any investment platforms that are not residency-based into which I could transfer my ISA, keep it there when I move abroad, and continue to invest in different instruments, just to keep everything in one place. I am not looking for portfolio advice, just a specific platform (Vanguard, AJ Bell, trading212 type thing).

I have looked at platforms specific to the country I'm moving to, it is **not the US** and I'm familiar with the tax implications of investing/having a foreign income out there. the only issue is I am not fluent in the language, not enough to be comfortable investing at least, and while I could hire a financial advisor I prefer to have my own control over my investments, so would prefer something I can fully understand.

investing,"Is investing in stocks already heavily favored by ETFs smart? Furthermore, is 100% stock portfolios worth the risk?","I left a comment elsewhere which after posting it made me curious about making it a post. Forgive me if I spell something incorrectly, English is not my first language.

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4590406

So I read this paper about 100% Stock portfolios after watching a YouTube video on it (multiple out there).

And I wondered how I’d go about choosing the stocks I’d invest in. I did so because just last year I didn’t touch stocks but when I went on my app on my iPhone (Stocks) and saw how much I could have made had I just invested in stocks that were already a big presence in almost all of my ETFs the. I’d have more value to my name.

To look at it I viewed an era that had large fluctuations in which I invested in which lead me to 2019 to 2024 because in-between that we had the fed-induced boom and the crash that came before that along with other crazy fluctuations.

So for my example I used march 2019 to March 2024 (which had steep decreases and increases):

1.MSFT: 250.92% 
2.Apple: 248%
3.Meta: 176.44%
4.Googl: 149%
5.Amazon: 96.46%

1.QQQ: 140.45%
2.VTI: 84.34%
3.VOO: 81.39%
4.VT: 54.38%

Here is the Summary of percentages those sticks hold for each ETF:

1. QQQ: ~41.3%
2. VOO: ~22.2%
3. VTI: ~13.0%
4. VT: ~6.1%


It’s not like investing in Meta, Apple, Google, and Amazon is unheard of, they already make a huge part of all ETFs you come across that measure commonly used domestic indexes. So… is this the way? I truly want your critique on this because if it works it works and if not then it doesn’t, it’s not about proving I’m right it’s about maximizing my understanding of investing. 



Edit: I think people misunderstood and I didn’t articulate it well either. IM NOT PREACHING FOR 100% stocks but I want your opinions on it! I want to see if maybe it IS the way. I want to grow my knowledge on the topic.

investing,My loan repayment plan for education,"Hi guys, I just completed the first year of University, and I’ve been using funds saved for me by my parents. Thing is, I will eventually run out, and by that time I’ll have to take out loans OR use my money that I’ll be making from summer jobs. For instance, this summer I’ll make around 13k cad after tax, and around 10 of that could go towards school. But…I was thinking about possibly doing something a bit different and wanted to get an opinion on it. 

Instead of using my summer money to pay for school directly, I basically want to invest it into low cost index funds or mutuals, aiming for 7 to 10 percent yearly returns. Then, I’ll take out a loan to pay for the rest of my education, and when it comes time I’ll just use the yearly returns on what I’ve invested to pay down the monthly loan repayments. This way, I’ll have my income more freed up to keep investing, as well as a nest egg of around 50 to 56k by the time I graduate.

investing,"Help stress test, poke holes please.","I have quite a bit of equity and thinking about ways to utilize it. Recently learned about ""home equity investment plans"". The idea is you borrow a portion of your equity and instead of owing payments and interest like in a HELOC the lender gets an equivalent % of your future equity. 

The one I'm looking at has a 5% origination fee and the term is for 10 years (no early payment penalty). 

For simple math if my home is worth 1 million and I borrow 500K. I built a spread sheet for home value increasing 2%, 4%, and 8% and average annual investment returns of 2% - 40%. Factored in combined state and federal capital gains taxes. 

Essentially my returns just need to beat equity growth by a modest margin and it appears to pencil out great.

3) Previous Employer 401k that includes both post tax 401k (incl employer contribution) and Roth 401k at location #3



I want to roll over my 401k from location #3 (previous employer) into location #2 (Current employer).  However, I see that it is possible to roll a Roth 401k into a Roth IRA.  (I have no interest in rolling the 401k into a traditional IRA).  So now I'm wondering if I can roll over the Roth 401k from my previous employer into my personal Roth IRA.

Is it possible to rollover the post tax 401k and Roth 401k from the same place to two separate places, executing one as a post tax 401k-> post tax 401k, and one as a Roth 401k->Roth IRA?

I'm happy with this however I'm wanting to add to it gradually. The thing is that I don't want to put lots of my money into the account in his name for various reasons, mostly its if I wanted to take out a loan in years to come after l've built up my (or legally my dads) portfolio, I would want to use the money I have built up as collateral. But if it's in his name I can't. So this leaves me with a question. How can I legally invest in my own name on trading 212? Or can I keep investing in his name and transfer it over to me once I'm at?

investing,Tyson crushed earnings but cautious of inflation risks,"Tyson Foods ($TSN) just posted strong Q2 earnings last Tuesday:

* Revenue: $13.1B (includes a $343M legal contingency accrual)
* Adjusted Operating Income: +27% YoY
* EPS: Up 48%
* Chicken: Best Q2 since 2016
* Pork: Strongest Q2 in 3 years (+67% adj. op income)
* Free cash flow: $382M
* Dividends paid: $349M
* Liquidity: $3.2B after repaying a $750M term loan

  
Margins also expanded in their prepared foods segment. Overall, very solid performance across the board.

broader commodity market trends:

* Corn Prices: As of May 2025, corn prices have decreased by approximately 4.09% since the beginning of the year, trading around $4.40 per bushel.
* Soybean Meal Prices: Soybean meal prices have shown a gradual uptrend, influenced by supply constraints and shifting trade dynamics. Prices rose from $417/MT in January to $508/MT by March 2025.
* Poultry Prices: Poultry prices have increased by about 5.30% since the start of 2025, reflecting higher production costs and demand pressures.

That said, I’ve been eyeing $TSN for a while and was already considering a position, this report adds to the case. But I’m still cautious.

The FAO’s food price index just hit 128.3 in April, a two-year high. That’s right near the levels that triggered unrest during the Arab Spring. Wheat and rice are spiking from export restrictions, and dairy is climbing fast due to supply issues in Europe.

Tyson is managing well for now, but if input costs keep climbing or tariffs escalate, that could put pressure on margins by late 2025.

biotechplays,Biotech Monthly Discussion: December 2024,"Well, that was a long neglectful period of not posting here. Sorry! Let's talk about stuff

There are some remaining catalysts this year, still! [Michelle Solly](https://twitter.com/MSollender/status/1841060373140541551) on Twitter has a pretty solid list of what's up in late 2024. [Sportsbios](https://twitter.com/Sports_bios/status/1863234779992461368) also has some interesting takes on some upcoming biotech catalysts worth reading. There are still plenty of interesting catalysts left. Let's talk about some of them!

$GALT -- This company is reading out a P3 for NASH cirrhosis, particularly for the slowing of the development of esophageal varices. This is going to be a long post, so I'll just say I have little to add that you can't find on [this fantastic writeup](https://biomusings.substack.com/p/galt-short) or [that fantastic writeup](https://biotenic.substack.com/p/galt-short-ph2b-navigate-data-december). I am not bullish, and judging by how expensive January puts are, I am not alone.

$GHRS/$CMPS -- This is an interesting quarter for psychedelics, especially with the new administration coming in possibly lowering the bar for them. $CMPS plans on reading out their Phase 3 for the treatment of depression with magic mushrooms this quarter, and $GHRS is reading out Phase 2s for their treatment of two types of depression with 5MeO-DMT (aka the psychedelic you get from licking toads.) Both have the issue that have plagued psychedelics and was a huge factor in [ecstacy treating PTSD](https://www.science.org/content/article/fda-rejected-mdma-assisted-ptsd-therapy-other-psychedelics-firms-intend-avoid-fate) getting rejected by the FDA earlier this year. How on earth do you get a placebo for a trial like this that demonstrates the drug is working? Either way, will be fun to get more data on how effective tripping balls is on treating depression.

$EWTX -- This one has surprisingly squeaked under the radar. Edgewise has a P2 readout for their drug treating Becker muscular dystrophy. This is an indication with zero FDA approved treatments. Earlier this year, in an open label trial, patients on the drug had improved their functionality on the NSAA scale to a notable level vs historical controls. We'll see how they perform vs placebo later this month. If so, it's an exciting >$1B opportunity and some much needed good PR for biotech.

$SAVA -- Just kidding, this already happened. Their Alzheimer's drug failed. The end of easily the most entertaining stock story of all time. For the full story, look under Findings for AlzForum's profile of [simufilam](https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/simufilam). It of course misses highlights like $SAVA suing the shorts for pointing out data fraud, shareholders filing [Citizens Petitions](https://www.chemdiv.com/company/media/pharma-news/2023/fda-denies-petition-to-grant-simufilam-breakthrough-designation/) and creating [misleading](https://twitter.com/LogarithmicDis/status/1863470950743994379) [short films](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEl6SbXR5hc) to promote it. I'll stop here before I add twenty more sentences. I love this stock cult, and I'm going to miss it. I can only hope that one day it'll get the retrospective it deserves, maybe a book or a movie.

Oh, right. We got a new president! In January, we'll get a new guy in the Oval Office who will probably embolden big corporations, which seems pretty good for pharma. He already has a pick for FDA commish that seems pretty by the book. However, his pick for HHS is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a crazy person who hates every vaccine and sees the FDA as an evil institution for holding back things like raw (unpasteurized) milk from the public. I guess a way to see this as bullish is that he plans to weaken the FDA making it easier for drugs to pass, especially psychedelics? Great news for $CMPS, $MNMD, $GHRS, and other psychs! If he gets the job in the first place, that is.

There's an H5N1 crisis a-brewing, with hundreds of herds of cows infected, and the virus now [being detected](https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-raw-milk-raw-farm-recall-5893b7b823efcaf4389b77fc01fb0c56) in the aforementioned raw milk! We're so close to another viral pandemic, one that is depressingly avoidable! Stocks like $CDTX (which is developing a tx that can treat many flu strains including this one), $DNA (which is developing testing kits for H5N1), and $COCP (also developing a flu tx with data in late 24/early 25(!), h/t roloboat) should be on your watchlist as more information comes in.",16,2,2024-12-07 09:39:13,"Biotech Monthly Discussion: December 2024 Well, that was a long neglectful period of not posting here.

We'll see how they perform vs placebo later this month. If so, it's an exciting >$1B opportunity and some much needed good PR for biotech.

$SAVA -- Just kidding, this already happened. Their Alzheimer's drug failed. The end of easily the most entertaining stock story of all time. For the full story, look under Findings for AlzForum's profile of [simufilam](https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/simufilam). It of course misses highlights like $SAVA suing the shorts for pointing out data fraud, shareholders filing [Citizens Petitions](https://www.chemdiv.com/company/media/pharma-news/2023/fda-denies-petition-to-grant-simufilam-breakthrough-designation/) and creating [misleading](https://twitter.com/LogarithmicDis/status/1863470950743994379) [short films](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEl6SbXR5hc) to promote it. I'll stop here before I add twenty more sentences. I love this stock cult, and I'm going to miss it. I can only hope that one day it'll get the retrospective it deserves, maybe a book or a movie.

Oh, right. We got a new president! In January, we'll get a new guy in the Oval Office who will probably embolden big corporations, which seems pretty good for pharma. He already has a pick for FDA commish that seems pretty by the book. However, his pick for HHS is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a crazy person who hates every vaccine and sees the FDA as an evil institution for holding back things like raw (unpasteurized) milk from the public. I guess a way to see this as bullish is that he plans to weaken the FDA making it easier for drugs to pass, especially psychedelics? Great news for $CMPS, $MNMD, $GHRS, and other psychs! If he gets the job in the first place, that is.

There's an H5N1 crisis a-brewing, with hundreds of herds of cows infected, and the virus now [being detected](https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-raw-milk-raw-farm-recall-5893b7b823efcaf4389b77fc01fb0c56) in the aforementioned raw milk!

TORONTO and HAIFA, Israel, May 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NurExone Biologic Inc. (TSXV: NRX) (OTCQB: NRXBF) (FSE: J90) (“**NurExone**” or the “**Company**”), a preclinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering exosome-based therapies for central nervous system injuries, is pleased to announce that its preclinical data on optic nerve regeneration study was presented today at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (“**ARVO**) in Salt Lake City Utah, the world's largest and most respected vision science conference.

The data, presented by Prof. Ygal Rotenstreich, lead investigator and Director of the Retinal Research Lab at Sheba Medical Center, showed that ExoPTEN restored retinal activity and improved optic nerve structure in a controlled rat model of optic nerve compression. The study, initially announced in [July](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=IXsXXWkQ1zt_qipBmJcujW2N61t7QEN-RIzzNfKYIvgV_SCek48JuPwsfR0FqwqumITgj8mdKp2Z3v61QPAwWGZwdUoOOqlbAjNn3xmaOuboWPHPbAiILPBKKyYstN_KnoR-ekbnLwkbgMVpPB90w5TCwzxJGzP5oNzV3Wxuv6Snlw7uSpzu-eE4bLQ7erV55ug9akx5O2T-Xyo5G23WAkM6YRqmHzFvqggUdebgQ3Ka9nd8mkTTI5GxIChnwtsXN9eg02NXYFzblHZCEhjPZm_be1kaYD1FhxcPh5GmDiE=) and [December 2024](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wr1yiW1wm-uWvd58qlLn1omtdO53lPk_rY1nIsjbH7bQlqul4pCoz1w5i7GXz7IKX7zjgwtantEg58kofd5vNqn34YwCxfWQQt4zwr85OS_BZfZ7EIayjmDEJLNikLk-MIqrLuCNg076U9-STwi7fHHgcUuzdLI033sodWSSpw8SWU7YgxpusLuBiyPezlkyn4vPsmrq8ENOHHNnLmKJ-Ci1OZDqho_56nStKXGnlM-9za1I8gutIpx_9k8nyBfBusxNjE6rcbU6xZtpxFuP4g==), has since been expanded to include a larger group of animals.

Prof. Ygal Rotenstreich commented “We’re proud to present this progress in optic nerve regeneration at ARVO, where the future of vision science is shaped”. He further noted “Our presentation generated a lot of interest from our peers and the scientific community who are anxiously awaiting real breakthroughs in this field.

Prof. Michael Belkin, founder of Tel Aviv University's Goldschleger Eye Research Institute where the study took place and a member of NurExone’s Scientific Advisory Board, noted “The results presented at ARVO show a distinct possibility that ExoPTEN can be used in treating optic nerve pathologies. We are proceeding to study an actual glaucoma model to examine the possibility of treating optic nerves which cause vision incapacitation from this common disease.”

Dr. Lior Shaltiel, CEO of NurExone also added “We’re seeing damaged neurons survive and regain function in models that were previously considered irreversible, challenging long-standing assumptions in neurodegeneration. Acute glaucoma carries a high risk of irreversible blindness and an associated economic burden that costs the healthcare system billions per year^(1). By preserving vision in even a fraction of these cases, a therapy, like ExoPTEN, could deliver clinical and economic value.”

The therapy for acute glaucoma is being developed as part of NurExone’s broader ExoTherapy™ platform, which also includes programs for spinal cord and facial nerve regeneration. In preclinical spinal cord studies, ExoPTEN restored motor function in 75% of animals following complete transection. Like its ophthalmic applications, the spinal and facial nerve programs use the same exosome-based product, supporting a modular and scalable approach to nervous system repair.

The ARVO Annual Meeting is the largest and most respected gathering in vision research, bringing together over 10,000 experts from academia, industry, and clinical practice. NurExone’s inclusion in the ARVO scientific program reflects growing recognition of exosome-based strategies as a potential new frontier in regenerative medicine.

The study, initially announced in [July](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=IXsXXWkQ1zt_qipBmJcujW2N61t7QEN-RIzzNfKYIvgV_SCek48JuPwsfR0FqwqumITgj8mdKp2Z3v61QPAwWGZwdUoOOqlbAjNn3xmaOuboWPHPbAiILPBKKyYstN_KnoR-ekbnLwkbgMVpPB90w5TCwzxJGzP5oNzV3Wxuv6Snlw7uSpzu-eE4bLQ7erV55ug9akx5O2T-Xyo5G23WAkM6YRqmHzFvqggUdebgQ3Ka9nd8mkTTI5GxIChnwtsXN9eg02NXYFzblHZCEhjPZm_be1kaYD1FhxcPh5GmDiE=) and [December 2024](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wr1yiW1wm-uWvd58qlLn1omtdO53lPk_rY1nIsjbH7bQlqul4pCoz1w5i7GXz7IKX7zjgwtantEg58kofd5vNqn34YwCxfWQQt4zwr85OS_BZfZ7EIayjmDEJLNikLk-MIqrLuCNg076U9-STwi7fHHgcUuzdLI033sodWSSpw8SWU7YgxpusLuBiyPezlkyn4vPsmrq8ENOHHNnLmKJ-Ci1OZDqho_56nStKXGnlM-9za1I8gutIpx_9k8nyBfBusxNjE6rcbU6xZtpxFuP4g==), has since been expanded to include a larger group of animals.

Prof. Ygal Rotenstreich commented “We’re proud to present this progress in optic nerve regeneration at ARVO, where the future of vision science is shaped”. He further noted “Our presentation generated a lot of interest from our peers and the scientific community who are anxiously awaiting real breakthroughs in this field.

Prof. Michael Belkin, founder of Tel Aviv University's Goldschleger Eye Research Institute where the study took place and a member of NurExone’s Scientific Advisory Board, noted “The results presented at ARVO show a distinct possibility that ExoPTEN can be used in treating optic nerve pathologies. We are proceeding to study an actual glaucoma model to examine the possibility of treating optic nerves which cause vision incapacitation from this common disease.”

Dr. Lior Shaltiel, CEO of NurExone also added “We’re seeing damaged neurons survive and regain function in models that were previously considered irreversible, challenging long-standing assumptions in neurodegeneration. Acute glaucoma carries a high risk of irreversible blindness and an associated economic burden that costs the healthcare system billions per year^(1). By preserving vision in even a fraction of these cases, a therapy, like ExoPTEN, could deliver clinical and economic value.”

The therapy for acute glaucoma is being developed as part of NurExone’s broader ExoTherapy™ platform, which also includes programs for spinal cord and facial nerve regeneration. In preclinical spinal cord studies, ExoPTEN restored motor function in 75% of animals following complete transection. Like its ophthalmic applications, the spinal and facial nerve programs use the same exosome-based product, supporting a modular and scalable approach to nervous system repair.

The ARVO Annual Meeting is the largest and most respected gathering in vision research, bringing together over 10,000 experts from academia, industry, and clinical practice. NurExone’s inclusion in the ARVO scientific program reflects growing recognition of exosome-based strategies as a potential new frontier in regenerative medicine.

biotechplays,NurExone Biologic (NRX): A Biotech Stock Turning Heads in 2025,"NurExone Biologic Inc. (TSXV: NRX, OTCQB: NRXBF), an Israeli-based biopharmaceutical innovator, is generating growing interest among biotech investors thanks to its pioneering approach to treating traumatic neurological injuries. Using proprietary exosome-based delivery technology, NurExone (NRX) is entering a new phase of clinical readiness while positioning itself as a key player in the evolving regenerative medicine market.

**A New Frontier in Spinal Cord Injury Treatment**

NurExone’s (NRX) flagship candidate, **ExoPTEN**, is a non-invasive intranasal therapy designed to treat acute spinal cord injuries (SCI). It harnesses exosomes—naturally occurring nano-vesicles that can deliver therapeutic proteins and genetic materials to targeted cells in the central nervous system. This platform represents a shift from invasive and risky surgical interventions to a safer, scalable, and more targeted delivery method.

In preclinical studies published by the company and referenced in their official presentations, ExoPTEN restored motor function and bladder control in approximately 75% of treated lab animals. Encouraged by these findings, the company is preparing to file an **Investigational New Drug (IND)** application with the FDA for human clinical trials, a significant milestone that could unlock further value for NurExone (NRX).

**Expanding the Pipeline Beyond SCI**

NurExone (NRX) isn’t stopping at spinal cord injury. Its **ExoTherapy platform** is being evaluated for multiple other indications including:

* **Optic nerve regeneration**, with promising results mentioned in their January 2024 press release.
* **Facial nerve damage**, shown in early-stage preclinical models.
* **Traumatic brain injury (TBI)**, flagged in their investor deck as a future target for pipeline expansion.

These programs are still in the research phase, but early results support the company’s thesis that exosome-based drug delivery can revolutionize how we treat damage to the nervous system.

**Building a North American Foothold**

In February 2025, NurExone (NRX) publicly announced the formation of **Exo-Top Inc.**, a U.S. subsidiary tasked with manufacturing and commercializing exosome therapies. Leading the charge is newly appointed executive Jacob Licht, as confirmed in the company’s February press release.

Just weeks later, NurExone (NRX) reported raising **C$2.3 million** through a private placement, disclosed via a newswire statement, to support ExoPTEN’s clinical pathway and build a GMP-compliant production facility in the United States.

“This capital allows us to move from research to execution,” said CEO Lior Shaltiel in a publicly available statement. “We are entering the next phase of our journey toward regulatory and commercial milestones.”

**Market Sentiment: Gaining Traction**

Despite broader biotech volatility, NurExone (NRX) has maintained upward momentum:

* **Stock Price**: As of early May 2025, shares are trading around **CA$0.70**, according to data from Yahoo Finance.
* **Analyst Target**: Public sources including Simply Wall St and Fintel have shown one-year targets averaging **CA$2.10**—nearly **200% upside** potential.
* **Momentum**: Trading platforms such as TradingView display positive technical indicators for NRXBF.

NurExone’s (NRX) inclusion in the **2025 TSX Venture 50™**, officially announced by the TSX Venture Exchange, highlights its role as one of the exchange’s top-performing companies.

**How It Stands Against the Competition**

Unlike traditional biotech companies relying on synthetic molecules or monoclonal antibodies, NurExone’s (NRX) unique exosome approach is drawing market attention. Peer companies like **Regenxbio**(NASDAQ: RGNX), **Athersys** (OTC: ATHXQ), and **BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics** (NASDAQ: BCLI) are developing therapies for neurological conditions, but most do not utilize the same non-invasive exosome-based delivery mechanism.

NurExone’s early-stage valuation may present an asymmetric opportunity compared to these later-stage firms with larger market caps.

**Final Thoughts: A Speculative Buy with Strong Fundamentals**

NurExone (NRX) is still in the early innings of clinical development, and biotech investing always carries inherent risk. That said, its unique approach, strong preclinical data, increasing investor traction, and strategic North American expansion make it one of the more intriguing small-cap biotech plays of 2025.

With the right clinical milestones, NurExone (NRX) could become a breakout story in the regenerative medicine space. Investors looking for innovative disruption in biotech may want to keep this ticker—NRX—on their radar.",1,0,2025-05-06 17:28:38,"NurExone Biologic (NRX): A Biotech Stock Turning Heads in 2025 NurExone Biologic Inc.

NurExone’s (NRX) inclusion in the **2025 TSX Venture 50™**, officially announced by the TSX Venture Exchange, highlights its role as one of the exchange’s top-performing companies.

**How It Stands Against the Competition**

Unlike traditional biotech companies relying on synthetic molecules or monoclonal antibodies, NurExone’s (NRX) unique exosome approach is drawing market attention. Peer companies like **Regenxbio**(NASDAQ: RGNX), **Athersys** (OTC: ATHXQ), and **BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics** (NASDAQ: BCLI) are developing therapies for neurological conditions, but most do not utilize the same non-invasive exosome-based delivery mechanism.

NurExone’s early-stage valuation may present an asymmetric opportunity compared to these later-stage firms with larger market caps.

**Final Thoughts: A Speculative Buy with Strong Fundamentals**

NurExone (NRX) is still in the early innings of clinical development, and biotech investing always carries inherent risk. That said, its unique approach, strong preclinical data, increasing investor traction, and strategic North American expansion make it one of the more intriguing small-cap biotech plays of 2025.

With the right clinical milestones, NurExone (NRX) could become a breakout story in the regenerative medicine space.

biotechplays,Nurexone Biologics: Exosome Therapy on the Cutting Edge of Nerve Regeneration,"# Introduction

Nurexone Biologics is a preclinical-stage biotech company pioneering exosome-based therapies for neural injury repair. By harnessing tiny cell-derived vesicles called exosomes as natural delivery vehicles, Nurexone aims to regenerate damaged nerves in conditions like spinal cord injuries, glaucoma-related optic nerve damage, and facial nerve paralysis – areas with huge unmet medical needs. Success in this approach could revolutionize treatment for these conditions, opening up significant clinical and commercial opportunities for the company in the coming decade.

# What Are Exosomes and Why Do They Matter in Regenerative Medicine?

Exosomes are nano-sized, membrane-bound vesicles released by cells into body fluids. They carry bioactive cargo – DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids – that facilitate intercellular communication. Scientists have discovered that these tiny packets hold much of the regenerative potential of stem cells, meaning exosomes can convey healing signals to injured tissues without needing to transplant whole cells. Crucially, exosomes can be engineered to deliver therapeutic molecules (such as drugs or RNA) directly to target cells and even cross protective barriers like the blood-brain barrier. This makes them an ideal platform for regenerative medicine: they are inherently biocompatible, can be administered minimally-invasively (e.g. via nasal spray), and cause lower immune rejection risk than cell grafts.

In recent years, exosome-based therapeutics have gained momentum with dozens of companies in R&D, yet there are currently no FDA-approved exosome therapies. Nurexone is positioning itself at the forefront of this emerging field by using exosomes to deliver gene-silencing therapeutics that trigger nerve regrowth. If successful, Nurexone’s exosome platform (branded “ExoTherapy”) could not only address previously untreatable nerve damage but also give the company a first-mover advantage in a nascent market.

# Large Unmet Needs: Market Overview for Spinal Cord Injury, Glaucoma, and Facial Nerve Damage

Nurexone’s three target indications represent multi-billion-dollar markets with substantial growth expected as populations age and better therapies are sought. Below is an overview of the market size and growth projections for each indication:

* Spinal Cord Injury (SCI): The global SCI treatment market is estimated at around $7.2 billion in 2024, and is projected to reach $11.94 billion by 2034, growing at a \~5.4% CAGR over the decade. This reflects the high cost and lifelong care needs of SCI patients. Currently, there is no cure for paralysis caused by SCI – less than 1% of patients achieve full neurological recovery – so new regenerative treatments could transform this space.
* Glaucoma (Optic Nerve Injury): The glaucoma treatment market (focused mostly on drugs to lower eye pressure) was $8.7 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to about $12.26 billion by 2034 (approximately 4.5% CAGR from 2025–2034). Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally, affecting over 80 million people. Existing therapies help slow vision loss by reducing optic nerve damage, but they cannot restore lost vision – highlighting a critical unmet need for nerve-regenerative approaches.
* Facial Nerve Damage (Facial Paralysis): The market for treating facial paralysis (e.g. Bell’s palsy, facial nerve injuries) is smaller but still significant, estimated at $2.5–2.7 billion in 2024 and forecasted to reach roughly $4.4 billion by 2034 (around 4.8% CAGR). Patients with facial nerve damage can suffer permanent facial droop, pain, and disability; about 30% of Bell’s palsy and similar patients have long-term functional impairments despite current treatments. New therapies that actually repair nerve function could therefore command strong demand in this niche.

These growth figures underscore that all three target markets are large and growing, driven by aging populations, increased incidence of neurological injuries, and inadequate solutions. Nurexone’s strategy to address these conditions with one exosome-based platform could give it access to an aggregate multi-billion-dollar opportunity if its therapies reach the market.

# Nurexone’s Exosome Therapy Pipeline and Recent Developments

Nurexone’s lead therapeutic platform, ExoPTEN, is an exosome loaded with a proprietary siRNA payload that suppresses the PTEN gene – a molecular brake that normally limits nerve fiber regrowth. By silencing PTEN in injured neurons, ExoPTEN aims to unleash the body’s capacity to regrow axons and repair neural circuits. Uniquely, the exosomes are delivered intranasally (through the nose), enabling them to travel along the olfactory nerve pathways and reach the brain or spinal cord injury site non-invasively. This approach has shown striking preclinical results across multiple models:

* Spinal Cord Injury: ExoPTEN has demonstrated unprecedented recovery in rodent models of acute SCI. In two independent, validated SCI studies, rats treated with intranasal ExoPTEN showed significant improvements in motor function, sensory response, and even structural nerve repair compared to controls. Over 75% of ExoPTEN-treated rats regained motor function, and in some cases of completely severed spinal cords, previously paraplegic animals recovered the ability to walk. These outcomes, achieved weeks after paralysis, suggest ExoPTEN can spur meaningful neural regeneration where few if any options exist. Nurexone has leveraged these results to obtain Orphan Drug Designation from both the U.S. FDA and EMA for ExoPTEN in acute spinal cord injury, which can provide regulatory incentives and expedited review. The company is now preparing to file an IND application (Investigational New Drug) to begin human trials in acute SCI, with Phase 1 expected to start by late 2025.
* Optic Nerve Injury (Glaucoma): Building on its SCI success, Nurexone expanded ExoPTEN’s testing to optic nerve damage, the underlying cause of vision loss in glaucoma. In late 2024, the company announced that ExoPTEN produced functional restoration of vision in animal models with optic nerve injury. Treated subjects showed visual recovery approaching normal levels in preclinical tests, whereas untreated ones suffered permanent vision deficits. This is a breakthrough finding – current glaucoma therapies only slow degeneration but do not regenerate the optic nerve. Nurexone’s data suggest ExoPTEN could become the first therapy to actually reverse some of the damage of glaucoma. The company views this as a promising new pathway to treat a disease affecting millions, and it has made optic nerve regeneration (glaucoma) its second core indication.
* Facial Nerve Regeneration: In April 2025, Nurexone unveiled ExoPTEN’s efficacy in a third indication – peripheral facial nerve injury. At the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) conference, the company presented preclinical evidence that ExoPTEN can promote robust regeneration of injured facial nerves, leading to restored function in a rat model. This is the first time an exosome therapy has been shown to heal peripheral nerve damage like that seen in Bell’s palsy or Ramsay Hunt syndrome. The treated animals recovered facial muscle movement and symmetry, whereas untreated subjects had lasting paralysis. Given that a substantial subset of patients with facial nerve palsy suffer permanent deficits even after standard care, ExoPTEN could fill a major gap in therapy. Nurexone estimates this new indication opens up a third multi-billion dollar addressable market for the company. Notably, all three indications – spinal cord, optic nerve, and facial nerve – are being addressed with the same ExoPTEN drug, simply applied to different targets. This highlights ExoPTEN’s versatility in stimulating nerve repair across the central and peripheral nervous system.

The rapid expansion of Nurexone’s pipeline from one to three indications in just a couple of years speaks to the platform nature of its exosome therapy. As R&D Director Dr. Tali Kizhner noted, “We have shown three indications which can be addressed by the same ExoPTEN drug. A single manufacturing process serving multiple high-value indications significantly enhances the economic model.” In other words, Nurexone can invest in one production process for exosomes and one core drug product, yet potentially treat multiple diseases – a cost-efficient model for a small biotech. This multi-indication approach also de-risks the pipeline to some extent: even if one indication faces setbacks, others could still advance using the same core technology.

# Strategic Positioning and Future Outlook

Nurexone is strategically positioned as a pioneer in exosome-based regenerative medicine for neurological injuries. The company benefits from several key advantages:

* First-Mover Advantage with Novel Technology: With no approved exosome therapies on the market yet, Nurexone aims to be among the first to bring such a product into clinical trials. Its focus on acute spinal cord injury – an area with no effective drugs – could fast-track ExoPTEN’s development under orphan status and yield transformative results for patients. Positive human data in SCI would not only validate Nurexone’s platform but also set the stage for expansion into glaucoma and facial nerve indications where competition is minimal for regenerative solutions.
* Robust Intellectual Property: The ExoPTEN technology is built on research from the Technion – Israel’s Institute of Technology – and Nurexone holds a worldwide exclusive license to the underlying patents. A U.S. patent has been granted (with others granted in Japan, Russia, Israel and pending elsewhere) covering exosome-based PTEN inhibition for nerve repair. This IP position gives Nurexone freedom to operate and the ability to defend its platform across major markets as it moves towards commercialization.
* Multiple Shots on Goal: By pursuing three related indications in parallel, Nurexone diversifies its opportunities. Each target market (SCI, glaucoma, facial paralysis) is large in its own right, and success in any one could justify the platform. Yet the common therapeutic approach (ExoPTEN) means R&D efforts are synergistic. Manufacturing scale-up for one indication can serve others, and regulatory designations like Orphan Drug for SCI may aid in discussions for optic and facial nerve trials as well. The company’s recent achievements – Orphan designations granted, pre-IND meetings with FDA completed, and a growing body of peer-reviewed preclinical data – all bolster its credibility as a serious player in regenerative biotech.
* Strategic Flexibility for Partnerships or Acquisition: As a young biotech (founded 2020 in Israel), Nurexone has a relatively lean operation (fewer than 20 employees) and will require significant capital to conduct late-stage trials. Management is likely open to partnering with larger pharma or biotech companies if ExoPTEN shows clinical promise. The high value of its target markets and the novelty of its exosome platform could attract deals – for instance, big pharma might license ExoPTEN for commercialization in spinal cord injury, or even acquire Nurexone for access to its platform, as often happens once early trials succeed. Investors can take some confidence that the exit opportunities (via partnership or M&A) are tangible if Nurexone delivers strong Phase 1/2 results.

Looking ahead, the next 12–24 months will be critical for Nurexone. Key milestones include the IND approval and first-in-human trial of ExoPTEN for acute SCI (expected to commence in late 2025), as well as further preclinical progress in glaucoma and facial nerve programs. Any early human data showing safety and signs of efficacy in spinal cord injury would be a game-changer, potentially validating exosome therapy as a new modality in medicine. Given the enormous stakes – restoring movement to paralyzed patients, vision to glaucoma sufferers, or smiles to those with facial paralysis – Nurexone’s mission has a compelling humanitarian angle alongside its commercial upside.

In summary, Nurexone Biologics has leveraged cutting-edge exosome science to build a pipeline targeting three high-impact neurological conditions. By addressing the root cause of these conditions (nerve damage) rather than just symptoms, the company’s ExoTherapy platform could dramatically improve patient outcomes where current treatments fall short. The market potential is in the tens of billions of dollars across spinal cord injuries, glaucoma, and facial nerve injuries over the next decade, giving Nurexone a sizeable runway for growth. While still early-stage, the company’s strategic focus, encouraging preclinical results, and strong IP position it well in the fast-growing regenerative medicine sector. For investors knowledgeable in biotech, Nurexone represents a bold, high-reward play: if exosome-based regeneration succeeds, Nurexone could emerge as a leader in a new era of nerve repair therapeutics.",0,0,2025-05-06 02:18:08,"Nurexone Biologics: Exosome Therapy on the Cutting Edge of Nerve Regeneration # Introduction

biotechplays,GOVX: The Next Big up runner? Biotech Might Be Where Retail Strikes Back,"Not a YOLO, but stumbled on something that piqued my interest while digging through low-float biotech plays.

GeoVax Labs (GOVX) — sub-$10M market cap, clinical-stage biotech. Yeah, microcap trash territory, but here’s the twist: they’re working on immunotherapies, cancer vaccines, and infectious disease platforms. High-risk, sure, but this is the kind of thing that either dies in a dumpster or goes vertical off a single PR or FDA nod.

What caught my eye:

	•	Tiny float (potential volatility magnet)

	•	High institutional short % (though data is patchy)

	•	Recent chatter around upcoming trial updates / partnerships

	•	Trading at near cash levels — basically priced for failure

This feels like one of those setups where if news drops, it becomes a circuit-breaker meme. Obviously could go to $0 too — this is biotech after all.

(NASDAQ: MGRX), operating as MangoRx, is a Dallas-based telemedicine company specializing in men’s health and wellness. The company offers treatments for conditions such as erectile dysfunction, hair loss, and hormone imbalances through a secure online platform, enabling consumers to consult with licensed physicians and receive medications discreetly at their doorstep.​

https://preview.redd.it/4eyrweipxcye1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c17b2d2a4cda6e2dc7aead92a525cb486c2a671

On March 25, 2025, Mangoceuticals announced it has entered into a Master Distribution Agreement to secure the exclusive licensing and distribution rights for Diabetinol® within the United States and Canada. Diabetinol® is a clinically supported and patented plant-based nutraceutical derived from citrus peel, rich in polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) like nobiletin and tangeretin. Clinical studies have demonstrated that these compounds significantly impact metabolic processes, particularly in how the body processes and utilizes sugar and fat. Mechanistically, Diabetinol® works by improving insulin sensitivity, enhancing GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake in tissues, suppressing hepatic glucose production, and activating key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. It also reduces systemic inflammation and oxidative stress—two primary biological drivers of insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. This strategic move positions Mangoceuticals to expand its product portfolio into the $33.66 billion addressable diabetes and metabolic health market. ​

Following the announcement, Mangoceuticals’ stock experienced a significant decline, closing at $2.81 on March 25, 2025, down approximately 41.68% from the previous close. Despite this drop, the company’s 52-week range has seen highs of $16.80, indicating potential volatility. The recent dip may present a buying opportunity for investors who believe in the company’s strategic direction and its expansion into the metabolic health sector. ​

Jacob Cohen, Founder and CEO of Mangoceuticals, commented on the expansion:​

“Millions of people are left on the sidelines watching others lose weight using drugs they can’t afford. Diabetinol® is not a direct substitute for those prescription therapies, but the internal studies have concluded that it does offer complementary metabolic benefits in a safe, natural, and more affordable way. By harnessing clinically proven plant-derived ingredients, we’re providing a new option for individuals who cannot access or tolerate GLP-1 medications. Our goal is to help more people take control of their blood sugar and weight – safely, conveniently, and cost-effectively.”

Mangoceuticals plans to distribute Diabetinol® in multiple consumer-friendly formats, including capsules, ready-to-drink beverages, quick-release pouches, cookies, and gummies. Distribution channels are expected to encompass direct-to-consumer online initiatives via the company’s website and through online retailers, brick-and-mortar retail outlets, and affiliate marketing channels. ​

This expansion aligns with Mangoceuticals’ mission to improve lives through safe and accessible wellness solutions, addressing the escalating diabetes crisis and the growing demand for affordable metabolic health products.​",1,0,2025-05-02 12:58:52,"Mangoceuticals, Inc.

MangoRx’s weight loss solutions are designed to enhance metabolism, support fat burning, and reduce appetite using plant-based formulations.

* $51 million of pre-funded warrants priced at $6.9999 per warrant, with an exercise price of $0.0001 per

>Verastem expects to receive gross proceeds from the offering of approximately $75 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses.

>The private placement was led by RTW Investments, with participation from other new and existing investors, including BVF Partners, Nantahala Capital, Octagon Capital, OrbiMed and Stonepine Capital Management.

>The private placement is expected to close on or about April 28, 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

>Proceeds from the financing are expected to fund the potential launch of avutometinib and defactinib in recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer, continued clinical research and development of product candidates including VS-7375, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

\[[press release](https://investor.verastem.com/news-releases/news-release-details/verastem-oncology-announces-75-million-private-placement)\]

Some of the private placement investors already have positions in VSTM.  We will likely see some updated ownership filings. According to most recent 13-F filings, these were their positions at Dec 31st:

* BVF owned 2.1m shares 
* Stonepipe owned 870k 
* Nantahala owned 3.75m 
* Orbimed owned 2.86m

If you look at the YTD chart, VSTM spent a lot of time below $7. Securing a $75m private placement at $7 per share is a terrific move for VSTM. They could have tried to raise at lower prices in the past 6 months, but they were still able to get funds to buy shares at $7.

The $75m should provide a nice boost to their balance sheet. In the [March ER](https://investor.verastem.com/news-releases/news-release-details/verastem-oncology-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024), this was their cash position:

On a pro forma basis, taking into account the initial $75.0 million of notes and$7.5 million of equity to be purchased by Oberland Capital at closing, repayment of amounts owed under the Company’s existing loan with Oxford Finance of $42.7 million, and net proceeds from equity issuance under the Company’s at-the-market facility in January 2025 of $22.7 million, cash, cash equivalents and investments were $151.3 million as of December 31, 2024.

biotechplays,Mangoceuticals Is Reengineering the Self-Care Blueprint with Better Personal Health and Wellness Solutions,"https://preview.redd.it/243iozku3zwe1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f117cd8e4dd743950aa79c999641f0234065923

**MIAMI, FL / ACCESS Newswire / April 24, 2025 /** For decades, the men's health space has remained largely stagnant-held back by legacy brands offering generic solutions and treatment protocols that too often felt like quick fixes rather than genuine care. The result has been an industry shaped by stigma, limited access, and minimal innovation.

That landscape is beginning to change. **Mangoceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq:MGRX)** is taking a different approach, developing products that merge clinical rigor with user-centric design-responding to how people actually live today. With offerings that now span men's ED, hormonal balance, hair restoration, and weight loss-alongside a recently launched women's wellness platform, PeachesRx-the company is reshaping expectations across multiple health categories.

**Treatment Reimagined for Today's World**

Among the company's most notable developments is Mango, a flagship product that addresses erectile dysfunction (ED) in a way that feels more modern, discreet, and accessible. While ED remains a common issue-impacting over 70% of men at some point-treatment solutions have long felt dated, often defined by clinical detachment and social stigma.

Mango offers a sublingual, fast-dissolving tablet that delivers active compounds without the pharmacy line or blue-pill branding. The rapid-onset format avoids liver metabolism for quicker effect and a smoother user experience.

Available in two primary formulations-Sildenafil Mango and Tadalafil Mango -each product combines a proven PDE5 inhibitor with L-arginine for enhanced blood flow and oxytocin for emotional connection. This combination represents a deliberate move away from single-ingredient solutions, toward more comprehensive sexual wellness.

**Addressing Hormonal Health Through Oral TRT**

The focus on real-world practicality continues with Mangoceuticals' approach to testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). Low testosterone is often under-diagnosed or left untreated, in part because existing treatments-such as injections or topical gels-can be inconvenient, uncomfortable, or difficult to manage.

Prime by MangoRx introduces a more approachable alternative. At its core is Kyzatrex™, an FDA-approved oral testosterone capsule. Designed to deliver a consistent, daily dose without the hormonal spikes associated with other delivery methods, it offers a smoother, more manageable path to hormone balance.

Through the company's integrated telehealth platform, patients can complete lab work, consultations, and prescription fulfillment entirely from home. This ease of access helps remove longstanding barriers to care-bringing more people into the fold who may have previously felt excluded.

**Hair Loss Solutions with a Functional Edge**

As part of its broader expansion, Mangoceuticals has also entered the hair restoration market-a segment traditionally dominated by topical foams, shampoos, and overstated promises.

Grow by MangoRx is structured differently. Delivered as a mint-flavored, pharmaceutical-grade chewable, it contains a synergistic blend of minoxidil (to encourage growth), finasteride (to reduce DHT), biotin (for structure), and vitamin D3 (to support follicle health). This comprehensive stack addresses both the cause and symptoms of hair loss in a convenient daily format.

Rather than introducing another product that treats hair health as a cosmetic issue, Grow approaches it as a clinical concern with psychological and emotional dimensions. That distinction may prove significant, as the global hair restoration market surpassed $6 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 16% through 2030.

**Metabolic Health Without the Needle**

Expanding beyond core categories, Mangoceuticals has also stepped into one of the fastest-growing areas in wellness: weight management. Rather than replicating existing solutions, the company is working to reduce access barriers with two complementary approaches.

The first is Slim by MangoRx, a dissolvable sublingual tablet that delivers Semaglutide-the same GLP-1 receptor agonist found in drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. Combined with Vitamin B6, Slim offers a non-injectable, frictionless option for those looking to manage appetite and improve metabolic outcomes.

Alongside Slim, Mangoceuticals has secured exclusive rights in the U.S. and Canada to Diabetinol®, a citrus-derived nutraceutical containing nobiletin and tangeretin. These naturally occurring compounds are being explored for their potential to improve insulin sensitivity, lower glucose production, and reduce inflammation-making them a promising adjunct or alternative for those priced out of prescription GLP-1s.

**An Integrated Ecosystem, Not Just a Product Line**

Viewed together, these offerings suggest Mangoceuticals is building more than a portfolio-it's constructing a wellness infrastructure. The company's blend of telehealth, clinically relevant formulations, and lifestyle-compatible delivery formats reflects a broader ambition: to modernize personal health by design, not default.

At a time when many players in the wellness space lean heavily on branding or trend alignment, Mangoceuticals is emphasizing something else entirely: evidence-backed design, category-specific innovation, and patient-centric service.

Its long-term trajectory remains to be seen, but the early signals suggest that the company is operating from a different playbook-one focused not on rebranding old solutions, but on redefining what effective care can look like in the modern era.",1,0,2025-04-25 13:17:56,"Mangoceuticals Is Reengineering the Self-Care Blueprint with Better Personal Health and Wellness Solutions https://preview.redd.it/243iozku3zwe1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f117cd8e4dd743950aa79c999641f0234065923

**MIAMI, FL / ACCESS Newswire / April 24, 2025 /** For decades, the men's health space has remained largely stagnant-held back by legacy brands offering generic solutions and treatment protocols that too often felt like quick fixes rather than genuine care. The result has been an industry shaped by stigma, limited access, and minimal innovation.

That landscape is beginning to change. **Mangoceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq:MGRX)** is taking a different approach, developing products that merge clinical rigor with user-centric design-responding to how people actually live today. With offerings that now span men's ED, hormonal balance, hair restoration, and weight loss-alongside a recently launched women's wellness platform, PeachesRx-the company is reshaping expectations across multiple health categories.

**Treatment Reimagined for Today's World**

Among the company's most notable developments is Mango, a flagship product that addresses erectile dysfunction (ED) in a way that feels more modern, discreet, and accessible. While ED remains a common issue-impacting over 70% of men at some point-treatment solutions have long felt dated, often defined by clinical detachment and social stigma.

Mango offers a sublingual, fast-dissolving tablet that delivers active compounds without the pharmacy line or blue-pill branding. The rapid-onset format avoids liver metabolism for quicker effect and a smoother user experience.

Available in two primary formulations-Sildenafil Mango and Tadalafil Mango -each product combines a proven PDE5 inhibitor with L-arginine for enhanced blood flow and oxytocin for emotional connection. This combination represents a deliberate move away from single-ingredient solutions, toward more comprehensive sexual wellness.

**Addressing Hormonal Health Through Oral TRT**

The focus on real-world practicality continues with Mangoceuticals' approach to testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). Low testosterone is often under-diagnosed or left untreated, in part because existing treatments-such as injections or topical gels-can be inconvenient, uncomfortable, or difficult to manage.

Prime by MangoRx introduces a more approachable alternative. At its core is Kyzatrex™, an FDA-approved oral testosterone capsule. Designed to deliver a consistent, daily dose without the hormonal spikes associated with other delivery methods, it offers a smoother, more manageable path to hormone balance.

Through the company's integrated telehealth platform, patients can complete lab work, consultations, and prescription fulfillment entirely from home. This ease of access helps remove longstanding barriers to care-bringing more people into the fold who may have previously felt excluded.

TORONTO and HAIFA, Israel, April 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NurExone Biologic Inc. (TSXV: NRX) (OTCQB: NRXBF) (FSE: J90) (“**NurExone**” or the “**Company**”), a preclinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering regenerative exosomes-based therapies for central nervous system injuries, is pleased to announce the appointment of Jacob Licht as Chief Executive Officer of Exo-Top Inc.

TORONTO and HAIFA, Israel, April 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NurExone Biologic Inc.

biotechplays,"Harmony Biosciences (HRMY) 2x Upside, Good Margin of Safety, Near Term Catalyst","**Thesis Summary**

Harmony Biosciences is a profitable, underappreciated CNS biotech with a cash‑flowing core asset (WAKIX) and a deep late‑stage pipeline. Even under conservative assumptions, WAKIX in narcolepsy alone covers nearly the entire enterprise value (EV), leaving the pipeline—especially ZYN002 in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS)—as free upside (topline Q3 2025). I believe a massive overreaction to an RTF from the FDA and some overhang from a previous shortseller report has made this opportunity available.

**1. WAKIX in Narcolepsy: Core Value Anchor With Extremely Conservative Assumptions**

• Revenues: $850 M in 2025; $1 B in 2026 (company guidance)

• FCF Margin: 30%

• Erosion: 40% share loss from 2027–2029 due to anticipated TAK‑861 entry

• Generic Cliff: full competition begins Jan 1, 2030 (ANDA settlement)

• Milestones: $150 M deducted

• Terminal Value: none assumed beyond 2029

• Resulting NPV: $881 M (\~62% of current \~$1.4 B EV)

**2. Pipeline Optionality (Effectively Free)**

**ZYN002 in FXS**

• RECONNECT Phase 3 readout Q3 2025

• US target \~70 K fully methylated patients

• Peak US sales: \~30% penetration × $100 K = $2.1 B

I’m a physician, and anecdotally many of my colleagues would have no problem prescribing this and explaining the CBD connotations to families.

• Risk‑adjusted at 50% PoS → NPV $700–900 M

This PoS could have been higher, but unfortunately the trial is a little bit underpowered relative to the previous >90% methylation subgroup, making the margin on a significant p value razor thin.

• Global upside could double to $1.4–1.8 B

The company has hired a CCO with global experience, signalling a willingness to market this aggressively WW

**Other Assets**

• WAKIX label expansions (PWS, DM1, IH): combined PoS‑adjusted NPV $100–300 M

• EPX‑100 in Dravet: PoS‑adjusted NPV $50–100 M

I believe they overpaid for their Dravet asset, but this is all free upside.

**3. Controversies & Risk Mitigation**

• **IH RTF:** should have been expected by the market, there was no way the FDA was going to approve their sNDA with the data they had in hand, this was a moonshot. The \~30% plunge is insane given everything else they have going on, and provides us with a nice opportunity.

• **Short‑seller report (2023):** allegations rebutted by patent defense, rising prescriptions, strong FCF margins.

• **Insider selling:** CFO and CCO sales can be explained by normal activity (and the CCO being replaced)

**4. Financials & Capital**

• 2024 Revenue: $714.7 M

• 2024 Free Cash Flow: $\~150M (\~20% margin, though with major acquisitions to build a pipeline into 2029)

• Cash Balance: \~$500 M; 340M debt; buyback capacity (150M authorized - I think the company understands it is undervalued, but has better uses for its cash in its planned developmental programs)",4,2,2025-04-21 20:16:12,"Harmony Biosciences (HRMY) 2x Upside, Good Margin of Safety, Near Term Catalyst **Thesis Summary**

• **Short‑seller report (2023):** allegations rebutted by patent defense, rising prescriptions, strong FCF margins.

• **Insider selling:** CFO and CCO sales can be explained by normal activity (and the CCO being replaced)

biotechplays,Vaxart’s Underdog Story Is Just Getting Started – The Next Chapter Is About to Explode,"Let’s take a step back and look at the story Vaxart (VXRT) is writing.

This is not just another penny biotech. Vaxart is a disruptor. While the giants pushed traditional vaccine delivery methods, Vaxart quietly developed a revolutionary oral tablet vaccine platform — needle-free, shelf-stable, easy to distribute globally. This tech has the potential to reshape how vaccines are delivered across the world.

Yes, VXRT took a beating during the biotech downturn. But what many traders miss is that Vaxart survived. They kept innovating while others folded. Their Norovirus program is advancing. Their COVID and flu platforms are still in play. The IP is strong, the vision is intact, and the cash burn is under control compared to other biotechs.

We’re looking at a company that was once a $10+ stock with insane volume, now trading under a buck — but the fundamentals are better now than they were during the hype. The risk/reward down here is ridiculous.

What happens when one catalyst hits? Or when biotech sentiment turns? Or when someone bigger sees the value of an oral vaccine platform and wants in?

This is accumulation territory. Quiet now, but it won’t stay that way for long.

biotechplays,DD: Cereno Scientific (CRNOF) – A Biotech Sleeper With Big Potential,"**Disclosure**: *I hold shares. This is not financial advice – just a best effort to summarize the current state of Cereno Scientific as objectively and accessibly as possible.*

This is a follow-up to the DD posted about 12 months ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/s/YY6BZofeHt). Much has happened since then.

You’ve probably never heard of Cereno Scientific (https://cerenoscientific.com/). But if you’re into asymmetric biotech plays with massive upside and near-term catalysts — this is one to watch.

Cereno is a Swedish biotech company developing disease-modifying therapies for severe cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases — including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). These are progressive, often deadly conditions with limited treatment options today.

But Cereno isn’t targeting just symptom relief. Their approach is epigenetic modulation — in simple terms: turning disease-driving genes off and protective genes on. Think of it as reprogramming cells without altering the DNA itself.

**This is next-gen medicine — and Cereno already has real-world data to back it up.**

Where Are We Today?
- CS1 (lead drug) has completed a Phase IIa trial in PAH with remarkable results. 
- CS014 (second candidate) just finished Phase I and moves toward IPF. 
- CS585 is in preclinical development with anti-thrombotic potential.

Let’s be clear: in their Phase IIa, patients already on triple therapy (standard of care) improved so significantly on CS1 that one investigator reportedly contacted the company directly, shocked by the changes. One patient nearly normalized — an extremely rare event in PAH, which is a progressive disease with a life expectancy–upon diagnosis–of about 7 years.

What happened next? Doctors literally *refused to stop treatment* after the trial ended. They pushed Cereno to apply for Compassionate Use — and the FDA approved it. Several patients from the Phase IIa trial are now receiving CS1 long-term before it’s even approved.

That doesn’t happen every day.

**Recent Milestones and Upcoming Catalysts**
- Type-C FDA meeting – April 21 (this Monday): will shape the design for the Phase IIb pivotal trial.
- Readout from the Compassionate Use program (CU) – expected May–June.
- Topline data from CS014 Phase I – expected in June 2025.
- IND submission for CS1 Phase IIb – likely late Q2 or early Q3.
- Phase IIb study launch – H1 2026 is realistic.
- Several key conferences for partnership activity linked up, including Bio International (June 3–6).

**Cereno Now Trades on the US OTC Market**

As of this morning (18 April 2025), Cereno has quietly appeared on platforms like WSJ, Barron’s, TradingView, and OTCMarkets under the ticker CRNOF (see: https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CRNOF; the profile will likely get populated over the coming days). This enables American investors to buy the stock. Something several investors have been calling for during the last year or so.

Here’s the interesting part:

This OTC listing has not yet been formally communicated by the company.
But we suspect it will be publicly announced in the coming days.

**But Why Haven’t I Heard About This Yet?**

Great question. About a year ago, someone posted a detailed DD here (https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1cb8oxm/dd_cereno_has_presented_results_that_look_better/) explaining the fundamentals. It covered the leadership team (ex-AstraZeneca, ex-Abbott), the science, the platform, and the massive opportunity behind CS1 and CS014.

**Since then?**
- The Phase IIa results were strong and impressive, with clear signs of disease modifying abilities.
- FDA approved Compassionate Use.
- The pipeline has progressed.
- Talks with Big Pharma are ongoing (confirmed by the CEO).
- OTC entry quietly happened.

The company has been methodical — but clearly positioning for something bigger.

**Valuation Snapshot**
- Current market cap: ~$195M USD
- YTD return: +76.39% past 12 months, of which +49.85% the last 3 months
- Edison Group valuation: 14.2 SEK/share (~$1.3 USD) - conservative valuation to say the least 

Despite this recent rally, Cereno remains **significantly undervalued**. The stock has barely tapped into its potential, particularly in light of clinical progress, pipeline maturity, and regulatory milestones approaching in Q2 and Q3 2025.

For comparison, Sotatercept (Winrevair) — the only newly approved drug in PAH — was acquired by Merck for $11.5B USD in 2021, based on mid-stage data. Today, Cereno trades at less than 2% of that valuation, despite reporting data that surprised even the principal investigators and enabled FDA-approved Compassionate Use — a rare outcome for a Phase 2a program.

Notably, Cereno is on track to be considered best-in-class in terms of *safety and tolerability*, as reaffirmed in the recent Biostock interview with CEO Sten Sörensen and CMO Rahul Agrawal (https://youtu.be/IqLm5ZO2LYw?si=gOphhQo8Ojpllisb). This edge is expected to play a pivotal role in future partnering or licensing discussions.

That’s without factoring in:
- CS014 in IPF (massive unmet need)
- The value of CS585
- Potential expansion into other indications like thrombosis and fibrosis
- The value of long-term Compassionate Use data, which few competitors can match

**Closing Thoughts**

Cereno is shaping up to be a classic under-the-radar biotech play:
- Real clinical data — not just “promising preclinical stuff”
- A unique mechanism of action with epigenetic modulation
- Strong leadership and board, including global COPDs in cardiology
- FDA traction, clear regulatory path, and global patent protection
- Now accessible to US retail via OTC (CRNOF)

It’s early — but the pieces are coming together.

biotechplays,VXRT: Pill-based COVID vaccine buried by the system — May catalyst could revive it,"Vaxart ($VXRT) created a pill-form COVID vaccine — no needles, no cold storage, easier global distribution, and potential mucosal immunity. But despite early promise, the government halted their trial via the HHS, while injections dominated the market.

Now they have a formal review scheduled in May to determine next steps. With a reverse split on the table, the float would shrink dramatically. If the review clears them to resume, this could re-ignite interest fast — especially with such disruptive tech.

biotechplays,$MUEL - Big benefactor from reshoring pharmaceutical manufacturing to the US,"**Company overview**: Paul Mueller Company, headquartered in Springfield Missouri, is a domestic manufacturer of high-quality stainless-steel tanks and related industrial processing equipment for end markets that include: pharmaceutical ingredient production (largest sector by far), dairy farming, beer/alcohol production, and chemical/energy production.

**Current play/growth driver – Reshoring of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing**:

* The Trump administration is pushing to reshore pharmaceutical manufacturing to the United States through proposed tariffs on imported drugs, aiming to incentivize companies to relocate production from countries like China and India back to the US. This strategy seeks to reduce reliance on foreign supply chains, particularly for active pharmaceutical ingredients, by making domestic production more financially viable. By bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., domestic integrators like Paul Mueller CO will benefit from increased investment and job creation. Companies like $LLY, $JNJ and $NVS have already announced multi billion dollar commitments to reshore pharmaceutical manufacturing to the US and will need to contract companies like Paul Mueller to design, build and install necessary drug manufacturing equipment.

* Several states like Missouri and Iowa, where $MUEL heavily operates in, are actively promoting the reshoring of pharmaceutical manufacturing, particularly active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), with the states awarding muti-million dollar grants and contracts to support these efforts. For example, looking at Missouri specifically, the state in association with its API Innovation Center at the University of Missouri–St. Louis announced this past February that they are aiming to reshore manufacturing for at least 25 essential medications and have announced several multi million-dollar contracts. Furthermore, several companies like Kindeva, MilliporeSigma and Boehringer Ingelheim have publicly announced their intentions to reshore drug manufacturing to the Missouri area with investments ranging from 76-100+ million.

* Some of these investments are already having an impact on Paul Muellers financials as the company has already announced accepting purchase orders totaling 120m from the pharmaceutical market in March of this year (orders that are to be completed from now until late 2026).

* The company has noticed the ongoing macroeconomic tends and is strategically growing; has announced multiple expansions to its Components Products facilities that are focused on modular construction of large pharmaceutical and processing equipment and product development.

**Key Financial metrics (FY 2024) - indicate the company has very attractive valuation metrics**:

* Revenue: $248,585,000 (8.5% growth from 2023, poised for accelerating growth given increasing reshoring efforts/macroeconomic trends)
* Net Income: $29,672,000 (41% growth from adjusted 2023)
* Market Cap: ~$234,209,250 (At $250 stock price)
* P/E Ratio: ~8.3 (Undervalued compared to industry norms of 15-25)
* EV/EBITDA: ~5.1 (Undervalued compared to industry norms of 8-12)
* Cash and Cash Equivalents: $21,169,000 (Exceeds total debt)
* Total Debt: ~$8,146,000 (Long-term + current liabilities)

**Broader impact of Tariffs**: The current administration's tariff policies could further benefit Paul Mueller even beyond its pharmaceutical manufacturing segment, particularly its farming and chemical/energy segment could also serve to significantly improve. Tariffs will make imported equipment costlier, favoring domestic manufacturers. For instance, large dairy farming companies historically benefited from cheaper imported equipment, but tariffs could shift focus back to domestic suppliers like Paul Mueller. While the tariff impacts will undoubtedly be nuanced, as tariffs could also increase costs for Paul Mueller as they heavily utilize steel as a raw good, though its domestic manufacturing base suggests net benefits.

**Stock Buyback program**: On March 31, 2025, the company announced a tender offer to repurchase up to $15 million worth of shares at $250 per share, a 25% premium over the then-current trading price of $199. This move, effective until May 7, 2025, reflects management's confidence in the future direction of the company. Furthermore, the company has done multiple stock buy backs historically to return excess cash to shareholders.

**Conclusion**: Key financials and the macroeconomic outlook indicate a significant gap between the business's intrinsic value and its current share price, even when considering that the stock price is up >200% in the past year. Reshoring of pharmaceutical manufacturing will drive continued growth.

While the tariff impacts will undoubtedly be nuanced, as tariffs could also increase costs for Paul Mueller as they heavily utilize steel as a raw good, though its domestic manufacturing base suggests net benefits.

**Stock Buyback program**: On March 31, 2025, the company announced a tender offer to repurchase up to $15 million worth of shares at $250 per share, a 25% premium over the then-current trading price of $199. This move, effective until May 7, 2025, reflects management's confidence in the future direction of the company. Furthermore, the company has done multiple stock buy backs historically to return excess cash to shareholders.

**Conclusion**: Key financials and the macroeconomic outlook indicate a significant gap between the business's intrinsic value and its current share price, even when considering that the stock price is up >200% in the past year. Reshoring of pharmaceutical manufacturing will drive continued growth.

**Fourth Quarter Highlights and Significant Milestones**

* **Advancement of ExoPTEN Therapy:** In Q4 2024, the Company achieved a significant milestone by advancing the regulatory pathway for ExoPTEN, its lead exosome-based therapy for acute Spinal Cord Injury. Building on successful preclinical advancements and productive interactions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“**FDA**”), the Company is actively working to expedite the submission of an Investigational New Drug (""**IND**"") application. This includes refining the necessary preclinical data, addressing FDA feedback, and ensuring all regulatory requirements are met to facilitate a smooth transition into clinical trials.​
* **Supply Chain Reinforcement:** The Company acquired a master cell bank, securing a reliable source of critical raw materials, strengthening its manufacturing process and supply chain in preparation for upcoming clinical studies and future patient treatments.
* **R&D Expansion:** The Company continued its research and development expansion by establishing in-house laboratory and office facilities, enhancing its research capabilities. The facility has been completed and fully operational since October 2024.
* **Study of Second Indication for ExoPTEN Therapy:** In Q4 2024, the Company announced results of an expanded preclinical study further demonstrating the potential of ExoPTEN for repairing optic nerve damage.

We remain focused on bringing transformative therapies to patients.”

**Eran Ovadya, CFO of NurExone, remarked:** “Our strong financial management and recent capital raise of C$2.3 million have provided us with the necessary resources to advance our strategic priorities - most notably, the establishment of a U.S. production facility to accelerate our drug pipeline and preparing for an uplisting to a major U.S. exchange. With our current funding, we are well-positioned to support operations and achieve key development milestones in 2025.”

   * **Private Placement:** In November 2024, the Company completed a second tranche of a non-brokered private placement, issuing 231,818 units at C$0.55 per unit, raising aggregate gross proceeds of C$127 thousand. Each unit comprised one common share and one common share purchase warrant exercisable at C$0.70, subject to acceleration.
   * **Common Share Purchase Warrant Exercises:** In Q4-2024\*\*,\*\* the Company received approximately C$114 thousand from the exercise of 324,77 common share purchase warrants at C$0.35 per warrant.

**Dr. Lior Shaltiel, CEO of NurExone, stated:** “Our progress in 2024 underscores our commitment to advancing exosome-based regenerative medicine. The groundwork laid this year, including key regulatory steps, R&D expansion, and financing activities, positions us well for the next phase of clinical development. We remain focused on bringing transformative therapies to patients.”

**Eran Ovadya, CFO of NurExone, remarked:** “Our strong financial management and recent capital raise of C$2.3 million have provided us with the necessary resources to advance our strategic priorities - most notably, the establishment of a U.S. production facility to accelerate our drug pipeline and preparing for an uplisting to a major U.S. exchange. With our current funding, we are well-positioned to support operations and achieve key development milestones in 2025.”

**Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Results**

* Research and development expenses, net, were US$1.87 million in 2024, compared to US$1.54 million in 2023. For Q4-2024, expenses were US$0.63 million, compared to US$0.30 million in the previous year, reflecting increased investment in preclinical and regulatory preparations.
* General and administrative expenses were US$3.14 million in 2024, compared to US$2.12 million in 2023. For Q4-2024, expenses were US$0.85 million, compared to US$0.40 million in the previous year, as the Company streamlined operations while continuing to support strategic growth.
* Financial income/expenses, net, were US$0.03 million of expense in 2024, compared to US$0.02 million of income in 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2024, financial expenses were US$0.06 million, compared to US$0.02 million in the previous year. The change was primarily due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and interest expenses.
* Net loss for 2024 was US$5.04 million, compared to US$3.64 million in 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2024, net loss was US$1.55 million, compared to US$0.74 million in the previous year. The change is primarily reflecting increased R&D spending and corporate development activities.
* Cash position: As of December 31, 2024, the Company had total cash and equivalents of US$0.70 million, compared to US$0.54 million as of December 31, 2023. The change is primarily attributed to capital raised through warrant exercises and private placements, offset by operational expenditures.
* The Company remains in the research and development stage and has not yet commercialized any products or generated significant revenue.

biotechplays,Mangoceuticals Expands into $33 Billion Addressable Diabetes Market Through its Exclusive Rights to Market and Sell Patented and Clinically Proven Diabetinol® in the USA and Canada,"https://preview.redd.it/ofd1678kr7ue1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=766592e19d0712bea667ee349da9110c786def69

*Diabetinol\*\***^(®)* *is a clinically supported and patented plant-based nutraceutical* product targeting the pre-diabetic and weight loss marketplace

DALLAS, TX, March 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mangoceuticals, Inc. ( MGRX) (""Mangoceuticals"" or the ""Company""), a company focused on developing, marketing, and selling a variety of health and wellness products via a secure telemedicine platform under the brands MangoRx and PeachesRx, today announced that it has entered into a Master Distribution Agreement (the “Agreement”) to secure the exclusive licensing and distribution rights for Diabetinol^(®) within the United States and Canada.

Diabetinol^(®) is a plant-based nutraceutical clinically supported and patented extract of citrus peel rich in polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs), including nobiletin and tangeretin. Based on clinical studies performed, these compounds have demonstrated significant metabolic effects, particularly in how the body processes and utilizes sugar and fat. Mechanistically, Diabetinol^(®) works by improving insulin sensitivity, enhancing GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake in tissues, suppressing hepatic glucose production, and activating key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. It also reduces systemic inflammation and oxidative stress—two of the primary biological drivers of insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.

Under the agreement, Mangoceuticals will hold the exclusive rights to market and sell Diabetinol^(®) across the United States and Canada, expanding its product portfolio into the $33.66 billion addressable diabetes and metabolic health market.

“Millions of people are left on the sidelines watching others lose weight using drugs they can’t afford,” said Jacob Cohen, Founder and CEO of Mangoceuticals, Inc., who continued, “Diabetinol^(®) is not a direct substitute for those prescription therapies, but the internal studies have concluded that it does offer complementary metabolic benefits in a safe, natural, and more affordable way. By harnessing clinically proven plant-derived ingredients, we’re providing a new option for individuals who cannot access or tolerate GLP-1 medications. Our goal is to help more people take control of their blood sugar and weight – safely, conveniently, and cost-effectively.”

Mangoceuticals’ expansion into metabolic health is timely given the escalating diabetes crisis and the enormous total addressable market for such solutions. In the U.S. alone, over 30 million Americans suffer from type 2 diabetes, and approximately 97.6 million American adults—more than one in three—have prediabetes. Globally, an estimated 537 million adults are currently living with diabetes, and that number is expected to rise to 783 million by 2045. If current trends continue, projections suggest it could exceed 1.3 billion by 2050.

The healthcare burden associated with this is immense. U.S. diabetes-related healthcare costs are already over $400 billion per year. Meanwhile, global spending on weight loss and blood sugar–lowering medications reached $24 billion in 2023 and is projected to surpass $131 billion by 2028. Currently, many people are prescribed metformin yet discontinue second-line therapies due to cost or tolerability. With an estimated 50% of Americans actively trying to lose weight at any given time, the demand for safer, more affordable metabolic health solutions is surging.

We believe that Diabetinol^(®) is well-positioned to fill that gap. As a naturally derived, clinically supported nutraceutical, it offers a compelling option for consumers who either can’t tolerate or access GLP-1 drugs, or who are seeking to support their health with a non-pharmaceutical approach.

Mangoceuticals intends to distribute Diabetinol^(®) in multiple consumer-friendly formats including capsules, a ready-to-drink beverage, quick-release pouches, cookies, and gummies. Each product will be carefully dosed to deliver consistent clinical levels of Diabetinol’s active ingredients. Distribution is expected to include direct-to-consumer online initiatives via our own website and through online retailers, brick and mortar retail outlets, and affiliate marketing channels.

Najla Guthrie, Founder of KGK Synergize and a recognized leader in nutraceutical clinical research, expressed strong support for Diabetinol’s role in addressing metabolic dysfunction, “I believe that Diabetinol^(®) has the potential to revolutionize how we think about supporting metabolic health. Its unique blend of natural citrus-derived compounds has been shown to deliver meaningful improvements in glycemic control, lipid profiles, and blood pressure—offering a safe and clinically validated adjunct to conventional care for those with prediabetes or diabetes,” said Guthrie. She further noted that Diabetinol’s formulation, centered around compounds like nobiletin and tangeretin, has been shown in rigorous clinical trials to improve glucose tolerance and lipid levels without adverse impacts on liver, kidney, or other organ functions and believes that these findings support Diabetinol as a safe, science-backed option to help manage blood sugar and reduce risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease.

Mr. Cohen further added, “Obtaining the exclusive rights to Diabetinol is a major milestone for Mangoceuticals. We are proud to introduce an innovative, science-backed nutraceutical that aligns with our mission of improving lives through safe and accessible wellness solutions. Diabetinol’s arrival could not be more timely, as the world faces a metabolic health epidemic and we have seen that patients are seeking alternatives that are both effective and affordable. We believe Diabetinol^(®) can become an invaluable option for individuals looking to take charge of their metabolic health, and we’re excited to lead that charge.”

In recent years, there has been growing public awareness around the need for cleaner, more natural approaches to health and wellness. Leaders in the national health conversation, including newly appointed United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have emphasized the importance of reducing reliance on synthetic pharmaceuticals in favor of preventive, plant-based solutions, where appropriate. We believe that Diabetinol^(®) reflects this shift—offering a science-backed, naturally derived option for those seeking to support their metabolic health with fewer chemicals and greater transparency.

**About Diabetinol\*\*\*\*****^(®)** **Clinical Studies**

In a 3-month pilot study involving participants with impaired glucose metabolism, Diabetinol^(®) was shown to reduce peak postprandial blood glucose by approximately 50 mg/dL following a glucose challenge test. This reduction is considered clinically meaningful, as it eases the burden on pancreatic beta cells and lowers the risk of long-term damage caused by repeated glucose spikes. Diabetinol^(®) helped participants stabilize blood sugar responses after meals, which is essential for preserving insulin function and preventing complications associated with hyperglycemia.

In a 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes who were already on conventional medications, Diabetinol^(®) was shown to significantly improve a range of health markers. Among those taking Diabetinol^(®), 14.3% reached Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) targets (compared to 0% of the placebo group), 33.3% reached LDL cholesterol goals (vs. 15.4% placebo), 20% reached total cholesterol goals (vs. 12.5% placebo), and 83.3% reached systolic blood pressure goals (vs. 60% placebo). Participants also experienced improved glucose tolerance over time, with a slower rise in fasting glucose levels and improved Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) profiles—especially in individuals aged 40 to 60.

*Diabetinol\*\***^(®)* *is a clinically supported and patented plant-based nutraceutical* product targeting the pre-diabetic and weight loss marketplace

DALLAS, TX, March 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mangoceuticals, Inc. ( MGRX) (""Mangoceuticals"" or the ""Company""), a company focused on developing, marketing, and selling a variety of health and wellness products via a secure telemedicine platform under the brands MangoRx and PeachesRx, today announced that it has entered into a Master Distribution Agreement (the “Agreement”) to secure the exclusive licensing and distribution rights for Diabetinol^(®) within the United States and Canada.

Diabetinol^(®) is a plant-based nutraceutical clinically supported and patented extract of citrus peel rich in polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs), including nobiletin and tangeretin. Based on clinical studies performed, these compounds have demonstrated significant metabolic effects, particularly in how the body processes and utilizes sugar and fat. Mechanistically, Diabetinol^(®) works by improving insulin sensitivity, enhancing GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake in tissues, suppressing hepatic glucose production, and activating key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. It also reduces systemic inflammation and oxidative stress—two of the primary biological drivers of insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.

Under the agreement, Mangoceuticals will hold the exclusive rights to market and sell Diabetinol^(®) across the United States and Canada, expanding its product portfolio into the $33.66 billion addressable diabetes and metabolic health market.

“Millions of people are left on the sidelines watching others lose weight using drugs they can’t afford,” said Jacob Cohen, Founder and CEO of Mangoceuticals, Inc., who continued, “Diabetinol^(®) is not a direct substitute for those prescription therapies, but the internal studies have concluded that it does offer complementary metabolic benefits in a safe, natural, and more affordable way. By harnessing clinically proven plant-derived ingredients, we’re providing a new option for individuals who cannot access or tolerate GLP-1 medications. Our goal is to help more people take control of their blood sugar and weight – safely, conveniently, and cost-effectively.”

Mangoceuticals’ expansion into metabolic health is timely given the escalating diabetes crisis and the enormous total addressable market for such solutions. In the U.S. alone, over 30 million Americans suffer from type 2 diabetes, and approximately 97.6 million American adults—more than one in three—have prediabetes. Globally, an estimated 537 million adults are currently living with diabetes, and that number is expected to rise to 783 million by 2045. If current trends continue, projections suggest it could exceed 1.3 billion by 2050.

The healthcare burden associated with this is immense. U.S. diabetes-related healthcare costs are already over $400 billion per year. Meanwhile, global spending on weight loss and blood sugar–lowering medications reached $24 billion in 2023 and is projected to surpass $131 billion by 2028. Currently, many people are prescribed metformin yet discontinue second-line therapies due to cost or tolerability. With an estimated 50% of Americans actively trying to lose weight at any given time, the demand for safer, more affordable metabolic health solutions is surging.

We believe that Diabetinol^(®) is well-positioned to fill that gap. As a naturally derived, clinically supported nutraceutical, it offers a compelling option for consumers who either can’t tolerate or access GLP-1 drugs, or who are seeking to support their health with a non-pharmaceutical approach.

Mangoceuticals intends to distribute Diabetinol^(®) in multiple consumer-friendly formats including capsules, a ready-to-drink beverage, quick-release pouches, cookies, and gummies. Each product will be carefully dosed to deliver consistent clinical levels of Diabetinol’s active ingredients. Distribution is expected to include direct-to-consumer online initiatives via our own website and through online retailers, brick and mortar retail outlets, and affiliate marketing channels.

Najla Guthrie, Founder of KGK Synergize and a recognized leader in nutraceutical clinical research, expressed strong support for Diabetinol’s role in addressing metabolic dysfunction, “I believe that Diabetinol^(®) has the potential to revolutionize how we think about supporting metabolic health. Its unique blend of natural citrus-derived compounds has been shown to deliver meaningful improvements in glycemic control, lipid profiles, and blood pressure—offering a safe and clinically validated adjunct to conventional care for those with prediabetes or diabetes,” said Guthrie. She further noted that Diabetinol’s formulation, centered around compounds like nobiletin and tangeretin, has been shown in rigorous clinical trials to improve glucose tolerance and lipid levels without adverse impacts on liver, kidney, or other organ functions and believes that these findings support Diabetinol as a safe, science-backed option to help manage blood sugar and reduce risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease.

biotech,We should give more context for layoffs posts,"Throwaway because I’m pretty sure my whole group is on Reddit and get the majority of their “info” from it lol

If you are posting that Company “X” is laying off 10/20/50/whatever percentage of its staff, we should provide context.

Honestly, I feel fairly connected to the industry and 50% of their companies named here, I’ve never heard (as they are often really small). 

My (and everyone here) attitude towards the industry is massively impacted by the constant onslaught of layoff posts. However, there is massive difference in a startup X with 60 employees laying off 50% of their staff then, say for example, Merck laying or 10%. Even a company of 1000. These companies, in a decent climate, are barely getting by. Yet, I feel like current “vibe” of Reddit biotech is the latter, which isn’t fully the reality. 

This isn’t a big ask and honestly should be standard. Hyperbole sucks, especially in the current climate

biotech,r/biotech Salary and Company Survey - 2025,"Updated the Salary and Company Survey for 2025!

Several changes based on feedback from last years survey. Some that I'm excited about:

* Location responses are now multiple choice instead of free-form text. Now it should be easier to analyze data by country, state, city
* Added a ""department"" question in attempt to categorize jobs based on their larger function
* In general, some small tweeks to make sure responses are more specific so that data is more interpretable (e.g. currency for the non-US folk, YOE and education are more specific to delimit years in academia vs industry and at current job, etc.)

As always, please continue to leave feedback. **Although not required, please consider adding company name** especially if you are part of a large company (harder to dox)

biotech,Is the cell and gene therapy bubble bursting and where to go from here?,"I've been seeing Vor Bio's CSO sharing posts from his employees seeking new jobs, and it's gotten me thinking about where cell and gene therapy is headed. Vor Bio's approach—knocking out CD33 in hematopoietic stem cells, transplanting them into AML patients, then targeting CD33 on leukemic cells—seemed scientifically sound. Unlike more ambitious claims (like inserting any genetic sequence anywhere), this was straightforward. Yet, despite the solid premise, Vor shut down after negative clinical data.

Vor isn’t alone; numerous companies have folded after entering clinical trials or even earlier. Failures related to scaling or manufacturing are understandable since those issues typically surface only at industrial scale. However, when failure stems from the fundamental scientific hypothesis—the inability to reproduce the founders’ high-profile Nature paper, for example, it highlights a deeper, systemic issue.

I've personally experienced situations where companies couldn’t reproduce even basic positive results from preclinical models, despite claims made during funding rounds. Many peers have shared similar stories. This makes me wonder: how do such flawed ideas make it past rigorous - I assume- VC evaluations? Could better scientific oversight from VCs prevent millions from being wasted?  

Another puzzling aspect is the endgame for these founders. They must realize their products might never reach the market. Then it struck me: it might simply be a career strategy. Jumping from an academic or postdoc salary ($70–150K/year) to an executive role ($300–400K/year) for several years can substantially boost one's career and financial status. Post-company, many transition into investment banking or research equity roles, possibly even launching another startup.

biotech,A Theory of Everything Rooted in Consciousness,"Hello fellow rationalists,

I’ve been working on a radical yet logically structured theory called **Unified Consciousness Computation Field Theory (UCCFT)** — a bridge between physics, consciousness, and computation. It doesn’t demand belief; it invites inspection.

# TL;DR:

UCCFT proposes that **consciousness is not a byproduct of matter**, but the fundamental substrate — the zero point from which all dualities like matter-energy, space-time, and logic (1 and 0) emerge.

# 🧠 Core Idea:

* **Consciousness ≠ Mind ≠ Brain.** It is the **non-dual field** that *computes* the apparent dualities in the universe.
* All phenomena — particles, forces, thoughts, and time — are ripples in this **conscious computation ocean**.
* Like quantum wave-particle duality, the universe is simultaneously:
   * **Emergent** (via computation/information theory)
   * **Non-dual** (via a conscious field — think of awareness itself, not deities)

# 🚫 Not Religious, Not Woo:

* No gods, no mystical claims, no pseudoscience.
* Just a theory that reverses the materialist assumption: **instead of matter giving rise to consciousness, consciousness computes matter.**
* It aligns more with **information theory + quantum physics + cognitive science** than any religious belief.

# 🧮 Why it Matters:

* Solves hard problems like:
   * The **origin of information** in the universe
   * The **fine-tuning problem**
   * The **Hard Problem of Consciousness**
   * The **observer effect** in quantum mechanics

# 📚 Looking for:

* Feedback from critical thinkers.
* Challenges from physics or cognitive science perspectives.
* Collaboration to simulate or formally refine it.

# 🧠 Final Thoughts:

This is **not dogma**. It’s a starting point for a **post-materialist scientific inquiry** grounded in logic and evidence. You don’t have to “believe” it — just help test it.

Let me know if you'd be interested in the whitepaper or further discussion.

biotech,Career Advice: Switching back to Biotech from IT,"Hello!
I graduated in biotechnology engineering. 
During the course, I realized wet lab works—especially microbiology—just wasn’t for me. On the other hand, I really liked the dry lab and computational (especially SAS) parts. After graduation, I ended up switching to IT because there weren’t many opportunities in biotech and another option available to me was to go for higher studies. But I didn't want to go for higher studies as I had not figured out my interests clearly. 

The IT job was tough in the beginning, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly. It’s been about two years now, but lately I’ve been feeling kind of bored with it. I keep thinking about how I moved away from biotech and regret doing it and part of me really wants to go back to  Biotech - just not the lab work. 

Currenty,  I’m interested in switching back into something more aligned with biotech, ideally something that combines it with my current IT experience as i don't want this experience go into waste, but I’m not exactly sure how to go about it—and I don’t want those two years in IT to feel like a waste. So yeah, I’m just a bit lost and confused at the moment. 

I’d really appreciate any advice or guidance on how to navigate this or what options I should explore.

Thanks.

biotech,"How to improve my resume, if I don't have linear career trajectories","I created another post asking about some suggestions on how to overcome some weird career progression in the past, but I didn't include my resume. So let me try again. 

For context, in theory, I should have about 8 years post-PhD experiences: 2 years of academic postdoc, it wasn't very successful, so I decided to leave and moved into some IT companies (non-biotech) for 2.5 years (learned some new skills and also leadership experiences). Then, I missed biotech, but it was Covid. Couldn't get a better job, I decided to do another academic postdoc for 2.5 years. Last year, I got a job in a pharma company, but when I got the offer, they did not consider my experiences (because of academic positions and/or outside of the US industrial experiences), so they offered a position below what I was applying for. I was desperate so I took the offer anyway, but It turns out a total chaos.

If you were me, how would you structure your resume? Can you point anything that that can still be improved?  I sent out many applications, but either immediately rejected or didn't hear back at all. I feel like something wrong with my resume, or it is just not competitive enough. Also, I am tryng to secure some positions along the line of research and discovery (synthetic biology, high throughput screening, automation). Thanks for any feedback and suggestions.

Then, I missed biotech, but it was Covid. Couldn't get a better job, I decided to do another academic postdoc for 2.5 years. Last year, I got a job in a pharma company, but when I got the offer, they did not consider my experiences (because of academic positions and/or outside of the US industrial experiences), so they offered a position below what I was applying for. I was desperate so I took the offer anyway, but It turns out a total chaos.

If you were me, how would you structure your resume? Can you point anything that that can still be improved?  I sent out many applications, but either immediately rejected or didn't hear back at all. I feel like something wrong with my resume, or it is just not competitive enough. Also, I am tryng to secure some positions along the line of research and discovery (synthetic biology, high throughput screening, automation). Thanks for any feedback and suggestions.

biotech,MSc dissertation defense,"I'm about to defend my dissertation but all ofy plans were terribly ruined.
My first project was to evaluate thru qPCR and rnaseq the osteoinductive and osteoconductive potencial of a hydrogel based on natural polysaccharide in mesenchymal stem cells.
But, not content with this project, I've talked to my advisor and we agreed in incorporate a flavonoid in the hydrogel matrix, and evaluate not only the osteogenic potencial on MSC but also the immunomodulatory effect on periotneal macrophages.
Ends up, my laboratory had all the technical problems you all can imagine and we had to stop all experiments for 1 whole year.
Now, the only result I got are: the Raman spectra of the hydrogel pure and the hydrogel with the flavonoid. Biocompatibility tests of the pure hydrogel (MTT, hemolysis, nitric oxide synthesis - Griess reaction) - and, while I had nothing to do due to the lab lock, I've done some pharmacology network using the intersection of genes related to my flavonoid and genes related to osteogenesis, made some PPI and clustering, and PPI networks. Also, molecular docking of the flavonoid on important proteins for osteogenesis and immunomodulation, and ADMET to evaluate the possible behaviour of the flavonoid on the hydrogel matrix.
I know it lacks a lot of other testing, but my time is up, and that's all I got.
I've worked on my discussion in the following way: compared the Raman spectra of the pure hydrogel, the pure flavonoid and the hydrogel+flavonoid (it seems like the funtionalization went well), discussed about the biocompatibility of the pure hydrogel (from the in vitro testing), discussed a lot about the PPI network derived from the pharmacology network, emphasizing the genes with higher centrality. I've talked about each one, with comparisons and examples. The docking also went well, I've compared the energy with the agonists of each protein and they were all similar, and then, the admet supports a result that the flavonoid is good for topic administration and controlled liberation due to its pharmacokinetics properties.
I've concluded that the flavonoid in question, incorporated with the pure hydrogel, is possibly a good product for bone healing, and it needs some in vitro and in vivo testing to confirm.

biotech,FAS?  In this economy?,"Hi r/biotech, like many of you I am in between positions at the moment.  I was with a micro startup that, surprise surprise, couldn't raise funds and folded.  I've been a non-PHD bench scientist for almost 20 years at this point, and while I enjoy it I also can't quite see being a bench scientist at 60+ regardless of how I personally feel about it.  I'm applying an interviewing for new positions, and one of them is a FAS that will also manage some elements of BD (sales, sales support etc).  The idea of being an FAS is really appealing to me, and I think that I have some interpersonal skills that will work well for such a role.    I've read every thread I can find, but most of them are over 2 years old, so I'm asking again as things are much different in the state of our industry compared to 2022!



I guess the biggest questions on my mind are the travel requirement (50%) and career path beyond FAS.  I am just outside an east coast hub, so I imagine much of my travel will be local, but there will be plenty of travel throughout the eastern US.  For folks who have made this pivot, is it possible to balance family life with 50% travel?  I have two kids and want to be there for them.  Some portion of traveling is realistic, but living out of a suitcase is not- I'd be happy traveling within my hub 5 days a week, but spending 5 days in Texas every other week will be tough.  I will probe during interviews what the specific travel requirements will be, but I'm apprehensive so trying to get a better understanding of what I can expect.



The other is related to the future- some threads mentioned moving to product management, sales or other fields.  Have any of you made such moves, and have they paid off?  Is there long term outlook for such a move, or do most people burn out within two years?

biotech,What do we think about 'Most favored nation pricing' for Medicare?,"I recall Trump throwing around the possibility during his first term, and it seems to be up for debate again. Gist of it (with limited available details for now) is Medicare spending for individual prescription drugs must be tied in some knowable way to prices paid in other western countries.

But if I'm a US-based pharma, wouldn't I raise the prices I charge other countries' healthcare systems so that I don't have to lower Medicare prices as much? Maybe lower prices for Medicare a little, and raise prices in other countries (probably a lot)? This would seem to be the way to optimize revenue.

I wrote to my Congressman in 2019 (or whenever it was) apposing this potential change, but this time around I'm thinking more carefully about it. There should be some parity in pricing between US and other rich countries, shouldn't there? That's not explicitly what this policy is aimed at, but perhaps it's worth considering.

biotech,Masters Degree Advice,"I’m currently a BPharm student in the Caribbean with a 3.85 / 4.0 GPA. Over the past two years, I’ve been working in a private pharmacy, and it’s made me realize a few things: the field here is super oversaturated, and the pay is honestly terrible (the highest I’ve seen so far is around $30K USD though i haven’t seen many salaries). On top of that, I’m starting to feel like retail or hospital pharmacy just isn’t the right long-term fit for me.

So I started looking into master’s programs in Canada and the UK. I reached out to a few Canadian PharmD programs (as a backup plan) + MBiotech @ UofT to see if I’d even be eligible, but most responses were polite rejections. Only one PharmD program encouraged me to apply, but it still feels like a long shot. I’ve also considered doing an MSc in Pharm Sci, but most of those seem really benchwork-heavy. I wouldn’t mind that, but my undergrad only covered basic compounding labs due to limited resources so I’m not sure how competitive I’d be.

Just looking for some insight into what other programs I might actually qualify for in the UK/Europe and/or Canada. Feeling a bit stuck.

TL;DR: Caribbean Pharma student (3.85 GPA) looking to switch paths from retail/hospital pharmacy due to low pay + saturation. Exploring grad programs in Canada/UK but facing eligibility issues. Open to suggestions for programs I might qualify for

If it helps: 
- I’m strongest in pharmacology, pharmacovigilance, research methodology, pharmacokinetics, biology & pharmaceutics.
- i am doing my final-year research project next term and plan to do something quantitative

TL;DR: Caribbean Pharma student (3.85 GPA) looking to switch paths from retail/hospital pharmacy due to low pay + saturation. Exploring grad programs in Canada/UK but facing eligibility issues. Open to suggestions for programs I might qualify for

If it helps: 
- I’m strongest in pharmacology, pharmacovigilance, research methodology, pharmacokinetics, biology & pharmaceutics.
- i am doing my final-year research project next term and plan to do something quantitative

I started \~3 weeks after receiving an offer. 

It's tough out there, for sure, but hang in there. I have a pretty good network and I tried to work that network, but my offer ultimately came from application alone.

biotech,Advice for starting an intern position,"Hi everyone, I'm going to be doing a practical training semester in my university where I will intern in an institute for 6 months starting in August. I'm hoping that I will gain really good experience there, hopefully things will go well and after I graduate I will apply to do a Masters degree there too. Any advice on how to wow the institute while I'm there? 

I shall be working on bio sensors and short fatty chain acids. Mind you I'm an undergrad who doesn't really know jack shit, so yes I will go in and learn. That's the point but I would really really like to try and contribute more than a helping hand to a post doc, looking for any tips from experience or suggestions that would  help me generate ideas how to make the most out of this intern position :) ",7,6,2025-05-09 15:49:21,"Advice for starting an intern position Hi everyone, I'm going to be doing a practical training semester in my university where I will intern in an institute for 6 months starting in August.

biotech,"""Golden handcuffs"". not sure what to do as for my future career.","I know this isnt really the right time to be complaining about my position. i acknowledge i am very privileged and lucky to be in this spot. but i still want to get this thought out there before its to late.

I am in what i consider a golden handcuff. i have been in the biotech industry for 6 years (essentially my full adult career).

all 6 years has been in QA of some form. i am currently a quality engineer (or whatever else you want to call it) for validation/CQV work.

this is much better than what i used to do in my previous department/role. but its still not something i see myself doing for life. but i also dont see this as something that has a career path. other than management (which i do not want)

however, as i mentioned, i have ""golden handcuffs"" in place. i have been at the same company for all 6 years. so i have decent benefits.

i also get great pay.

my manager is great.

i am also hybrid with a very flexibility on it as well.

work is easy and not a heavy load on top of that.

everything about it is great and not something i can say has a downside. other than its not something i want for life.

i have a BS in chemical engineer. so i really want to get into something more technical and process related. basically MSAT if it came to biotech.

or ideally, something more closer related to traditional Chemical engineering (mass&energy balance, ASPEN, simulations, design, etc)

the issue is

1. if i want to get into MSAT, i am essentially going to start from the bottom (much less pay) and MUCH more work. probably 200% more work than i do now. i will also have less flexibility when it comes to the hybrid option.

2. i personally dont think its possible for me to get into a traditional chemical engineer related work. the only work experience i have is in biotech and QA only at that. i am WAY behind on what these company's are looking for. but also, this means i have to move (i have looked around in my area. commute is impossible unless i move) and NONE of them are hybrid/remote. its all 100% onsite. for again, less/similar pay, and MUCH more work.

not to mention, due to the current situation when it comes to employment, doing anything else seems like a big risk. and i cant afford to lose employment.

for anyone else thats in either quality engineer, or a chemical engineer, what are your career goals? and what do you think you would do in my position?",0,66,2025-05-09 21:34:41,"""Golden handcuffs"". not sure what to do as for my future career.
